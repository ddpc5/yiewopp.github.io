00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
As a product manager looking to integrate

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.955
qualitative data into your iterative cycle of design,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.045
there are many methods of research that can be used.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:12.900
In this section, we'll discuss three of the most popular methods of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.385
qualitative research used by product managers today: focus groups,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.055
interviews, and usability testing.

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:25.350
One of the most common methods for collecting qualitative data is the focus group.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.260
A focus group is a group of participants from

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.295
your target market gathered together in one room with a moderator.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:35.595
The moderator leads the group in a discussion of topics

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.210
around your product and/or a potential new feature.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.590
The thoughts and feelings of the participants in the group can be

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.055
used to ensure a product is going in the right direction.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.995
As a method for collecting qualitative data,

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.125
focus groups provide benefits,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.690
including that they are time-saving compared to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.765
other methods of one-on-one qualitative research.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.425
A focus group can typically contains 6-10 participants.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.195
So 6-10 people can provide their opinions at once.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:09.095
However, the shared nature of a focus group also has its drawbacks.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:14.300
For example, because the focus group has multiple participants and a limited time,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.910
the moderator doesn't have much time to dig into

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.085
any one individual's background or journey to using the product.

00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:26.045
Also, participants in a focus group may be swayed by the opinion of others,

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:31.255
leading to group think that decreases the usefulness of the qualitative data gathered.

00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.165
Another common qualitative research method often used

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.105
as an alternative to the focus group is the user interview.

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:44.800
A user interview is a one-on-one discussion with a customer or potential customer.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.780
The interview script may focus on

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.810
the user journey or seek opinions on a potential new feature.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.230
An interview has several benefits,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.150
including providing the opportunity to dig deeply into an interviewee's journey,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.740
including the ability to ask

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.875
follow-up questions to better understand a user's perspective.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.945
Another benefit is that, unlike focus groups,

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:10.110
an interview takes place with only one person at a time.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.530
So that person isn't as likely to be influenced by the opinions of others.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.560
A user interview does have drawbacks,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.795
the largest of which may be that interviews are time-consuming.

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:26.180
They have to be done one by one and often take up to an hour.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.650
Getting the opinions of just 10 people can take more than a full day of work.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.155
The third qualitative research method we'll discuss in this section is usability testing.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:40.550
Usability testing is when a user or potential user is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.330
asked to actually click through a product or prototype to accomplish a task.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.030
The usability tester may be asked to think out loud and explain why they're

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.045
clicking and what elements confuse them as they try to reach their assigned goal.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.845
Usability testing provides benefits,

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.260
including the ability to get feedback on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.975
actual designs and the ability to see issues with feature design in real time.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:10.010
Observing places where a users struggles or is unsure how to complete

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.275
a task provides data on how to make a product easier to use.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.940
While usability testing has many benefits,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.785
it also has drawbacks.

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:22.430
The most significant drawback is that usability testing is

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.485
only really helpful once a prototype or user experience exists.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:30.980
Usability testing focuses on the actual user interaction with the product.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.150
It is most useful in the testing step of iterative design instead of

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.380
in the explore stage like other qualitative research methods discussed here.
