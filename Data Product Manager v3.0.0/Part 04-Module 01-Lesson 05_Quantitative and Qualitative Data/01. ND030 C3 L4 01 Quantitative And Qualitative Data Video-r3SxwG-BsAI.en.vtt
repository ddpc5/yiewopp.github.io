00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
Hi everyone, and welcome to Lesson 5.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:07.365
Today, we're going to be talking about qualitative and quantitative data,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.305
including methods for collecting qualitative data

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.575
and integrating it into the iterative design process.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.990
We'll also discuss using the jobs-to-be-done theory to better understand our customers,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.820
and we'll learn about using the RICE framework to prioritize product improvements.
