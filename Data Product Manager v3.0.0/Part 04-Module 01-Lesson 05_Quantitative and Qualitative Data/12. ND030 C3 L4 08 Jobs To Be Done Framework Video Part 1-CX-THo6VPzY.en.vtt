00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Sometimes product managers, get to focus on their particular product.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.020
They forget to pull back and think more broadly about their customers desires.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.545
When looking at how a customer uses our product,

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:18.645
product managers should consider the ultimate goal of the product in the user's life.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.945
Customers don't buy a product for the sake of the product.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.620
Instead, they buy a solution to a problem.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470
As US marketing expert [inaudible] ,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.110
famously declared on why people buy a quarter-inch drill bits.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.230
They don't want quarter-inch bits,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.520
they want quarter-inch holes.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.070
The jobs to be done framework pushes product managers and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.600
designers to consider what jobs people are hiring their product to do.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.080
This job goes beyond the simple actions a user takes,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.230
and instead examines the motivations and goals a customer is trying to achieve.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.980
Consider a purchasers of a lawnmower.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.855
If you were to ask a lawnmower user the reason for the purchase,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:04.210
at first, they might say that the purchase was made to cut the grass.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.890
If that is a goal as a product manager,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.395
you might work to create a lawnmower that cuts grass faster for cheaper.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:12.870
But cutting the grass,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.960
may not be the final goal of a lawn mowing customer.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.190
By digging deeper, product managers could discover

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.635
the desired future of a lawnmower user to keep their grass low and beautiful.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.870
Perhaps at an emotional level,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.700
low and beautiful grass allows

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.500
a lawnmower user to show off to his neighbors and feel proud.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.015
By focusing on the job to be done,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.300
a product manager can think more broadly and may discover

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.795
different solutions that solve a customer's needs in a better way.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.300
In this example, a product that could solve

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.420
the same job of keeping the grass low and beautiful,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.415
is breeding a new type of grass that never grows above a certain height.

00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:53.630
By using the jobs to be done framework when

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.600
conducting research in iterating on a product's design,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.330
product managers will learn more about the challenges

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.845
their user space and the future desired by their customers.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:08.905
This information allows product managers to seek and consider more innovative solutions.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:11.270
When thinking about jobs to be done,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.815
there are three types of jobs.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:18.070
A job executor, the person actually using your product is trying to accomplish.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.065
First, the job executor is trying to accomplish the core functional job.

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:26.690
This is the direct result that the job executor is trying to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.890
achieve by using a product such as getting a quarter-inch hole or,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.930
as in our earlier lawnmower example,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.840
keeping grass low and trimmed.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.855
For another example, imagine talking to the user of a tea kettle.

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:41.150
At first, such a customer might say

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.860
the core functional job they are trying to achieve is to heat water.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.520
However, the true core functional job is to make a warm beverage to drink,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.785
since that is the actual reason the customer is using the tea kettle product.

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:57.785
A job executor might also be accomplishing related tasks,

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:00.470
which are jobs done either before, during,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.785
or following the execution of the core functional job.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.855
By understanding related jobs,

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:09.470
a product manager can find opportunities to add additional features to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.850
their product that help

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.080
a customer accomplish related jobs at the same time as the functional job.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.520
When considering our lawnmower example,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.135
our related job might be keeping grass green.

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:22.010
Often after cutting the grass,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.110
many users of a lawnmower might water

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.880
the lawn with the goal of keeping the grass healthy and green.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.970
Finally, a job executor is fulfilling an emotional job,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.880
which is how the job executor wants to feel or

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.215
be perceived after finishing the core functional job.

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:40.880
For example, for some users,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.960
a lawnmower might be fulfilling the emotional job of impressing the neighbors.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.335
For other users, the emotional job might be feeling proud

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:52.920
because the freshly cut line gives the children a nice place to play.
