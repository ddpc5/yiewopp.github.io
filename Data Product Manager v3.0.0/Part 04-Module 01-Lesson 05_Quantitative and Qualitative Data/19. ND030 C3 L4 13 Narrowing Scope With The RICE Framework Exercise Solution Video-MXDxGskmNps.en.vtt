00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
In this exercise, you were provided with the reach, impact, confidence,

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:10.185
and effort scores for five potential features in a customer relationship management tool.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:14.595
Note that I've converted the stated impact from massive, large,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.770
medium, and low to 3,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.380
2, 1, or 0.5.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.745
The confidence percentages provided have also been converted to decimals.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.810
To calculate the RICE score for each feature,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.185
multiply the reach, impact,

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.705
and confidence together for the feature.

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.825
Here is the product of those three factors.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:42.545
Next, we divide this by the effort in weeks to get the final RICE score.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:45.080
Here we see the result of that division.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.890
The second question of the exercise asked,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.645
"What order the five features should be prioritized in according to the RICE method?"

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:54.180
Using the RICE method,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.300
the highest scored feature should be prioritized first.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.750
Let's order by highest to lowest.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.340
That means the feature should be built in this order,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.195
creating a line bar and pie charts based on collected data,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.990
then uploading external files to attach as notes,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.025
followed by ability to share individual pages via Quicklink.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:20.465
Then if there's time,

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:23.299
social sign-on with social media sites Google,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.660
followed by social sign-on with social media sites Facebook.
