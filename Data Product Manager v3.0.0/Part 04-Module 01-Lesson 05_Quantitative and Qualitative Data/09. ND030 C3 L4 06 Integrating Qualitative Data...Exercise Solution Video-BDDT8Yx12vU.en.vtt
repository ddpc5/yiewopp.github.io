00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.999
In this exercise, you were asked to consider a scenario about an online wedding platform.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.150
The product management team noticed that their users are booking

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.240
photographers through the site, but not caterers.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.370
The product management team thinks this is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.170
because couples want to taste catering food in person.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.645
They begin to brainstorm features to address this need.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.510
The first question of the exercise asks,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.380
by beginning to brainstorm solutions to increase the booking of caterers,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.110
what stage of the iterative design cycle is

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.185
a product management team acting like it is in?

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:37.085
Since the product management team is coming up with solutions,

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:41.000
the team is in the explorer stage in the iterative design cycle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.330
Specifically, the team is in the ideation step where

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.615
the generation of potential features and solutions to the perceived problem occurs.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.190
Question 2 asks, what stage of

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.330
the iterative design cycle should the product management team act like it is in,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.470
in regards to the problem of under-booked caterers?

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.310
Based on the scenario,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.520
there is no evidence that the product management team actually

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.895
knows why caterers are booked less than other services.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.660
They can make guesses and assumptions based on their own experiences.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.010
But they still should be in the understand stage of the iterative design cycle

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.230
because they have not observed customers or

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.755
talked with them to understand their problems.

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:23.645
The team needs to take the step to talk with users and

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:26.990
empathize before they can define the problem users face,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.920
that results in fewer caterers being booked.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.465
The final question in this exercise,

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:37.465
question 3, asks if qualitative data would be useful at this moment.

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.190
Since the product management team should be in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.965
the beginning of the understand stage of design,

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.705
they still need to know more about their users' motivations.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:50.465
Qualitative data would likely be very useful at this moment,

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.270
as qualitative data is helpful when trying to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.650
understand the why behind the users' actions.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.705
Talking with or surveying customers who have

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:02.690
and have not booked the caterer on the site will provide

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.720
helpful qualitative information about

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400
the problems users experience in regards to booking caterers.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.275
After they get a better understanding of the why,

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:14.630
the product management team can then move into

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.510
defining the problem and ideating solutions.
