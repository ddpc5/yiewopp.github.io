00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Congratulations.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.875
You have just finished the fifth lesson of this course.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.930
Now let's summarize what we have learned.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.050
In this lesson, we first discussed

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.620
the definition and use of quantitative and qualitative data,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.110
including the benefits and drawbacks of each data type.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.240
Then we talked about how qualitative and quantitative

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.870
data are integrated into the cycle of iterative design.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.775
In the third part of this lesson,

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.880
we covered different methods of qualitative data collection,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.375
including focus groups, interviews, and usability testing.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:38.905
We also talked about the benefits and drawbacks of each method of qualitative research.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.940
In the fourth part of this lesson,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.315
we discussed the jobs to be done framework and its usefulness for

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.155
understanding the job customers are trying to accomplish with our product.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:52.220
We covered the importance of defining functional, related,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.430
and emotional jobs and learned how to create

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.435
a job map to reveal areas for further product innovation.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:02.420
Finally, in the last part of this lesson,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.635
we learned about using the RICE framework to aid and feature prioritization.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.490
By looking at the reach, impact, confidence,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.815
and effort for each potential feature,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:17.575
product managers can make better decisions about which features to build first.

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:20.405
Congratulations on completing this lesson.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:21.710
In the next lesson,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.130
we will look at running A/B and multivariate experiments to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.580
test the impact of potential new features. See you soon.
