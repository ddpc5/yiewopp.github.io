00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Quantitative and qualitative data each have

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.335
their place in product development and the cycle of product design.

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:12.765
Quantitative user data, which is most of the data we've discussed in previous lessons,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.615
provides product managers with great information

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.885
about how customers are using a feature or product.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:24.570
Quantitative data is the most powerful at telling you what a user will do or has done,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.505
but it doesn't let you know why.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.700
Qualitative data allows product managers to

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.955
better understand what motivates their customers.

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.270
Together, qualitative and quantitative data provide

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.260
powerful guidance that can guide an iterative cycle of product improvement.
