00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
For this exercise, you are asked to create

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.640
a job map that matches the process of hand-washing.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.770
Let's review the steps in a job map and what parts of hand-washing aligned to each step.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.225
To define the job,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.440
job doers must determine how clean they want their hands to look and feel,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.015
and how much time they have to spend washing their hands to achieve this result.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.935
In the locate step,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.845
the job of hand-washing requires locating a sink with running water,

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:30.500
some cleaning material like soap, optionally,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.705
the job might also require locating some way of drying hands.

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:37.220
Remember that the steps on job map should be

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.680
generic enough that they apply to all customers,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.515
not just how a specific customer does the work.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:46.835
For example, a cleaning product or soap is needed for pre-execution,

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.835
but if the soap is a bar soap or a liquid soap,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.220
doesn't matter for the job map.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.840
Preparation; to prepare the environment for the job of hand-washing,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.060
a person might turn on the water to begin to heat it up to the desired temperature.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.730
If using a hand towel,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630
they might also place it near the sink to prevent dripping when

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.055
going from water to hand drying during the washing process.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:13.430
Confirmation; to ensure they are ready for the job of hand-washing,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.415
a person will likely recheck that all the required elements are gathered, water, soap.

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:22.070
Hand washers also check their hands to confirm that they are ready to be

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.700
washed and don't have anything on their hands that shouldn't be cleaned,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.010
such as jewelry that might slip off,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.025
or a note written in ink.

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:33.710
Execution; when actually carrying out the job,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.920
the hand washer must apply soap and water to their hands,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.410
they must also move their hands around to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.140
get the cleaning supplies over the entire hands.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.630
Then they must run water over their hands

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.020
until the hands no longer have any soap on them.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.989
Monitoring; to ensure they are carrying out the job of hand-washing properly,

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.475
the job doer will watch to make sure soap is actually applied to their hands.

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.980
They may also look for a physical difference in

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.180
cleanliness if the dirt on their hands is visible.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.020
Modification; while hand-washing, a hand washer might need to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.360
adjust the pattern with which they move their hands

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.970
to clean off any visible dirt or soap,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.645
for example, especially dirty or sticky hands

00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:21.550
might require a longer amount of time or a more intense scrub.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.940
The studious hand washers are those with especially dirty hands and nails,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.400
might need to introduce an extra scrubbing tool to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.585
the process to be successful in removing dirt.

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:35.930
Finally, conclusion, at the end of the hand-washing job,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.225
the hand-washer must turn off the water and optionally dry their hands.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.970
This exercise also ask about the emotional needs served.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.700
When washing hands, there are several emotional needs a user might be looking to serve.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.180
For example, a user might serve the emotional need for feeling safer or healthier,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.965
they might also be serving the emotional needs of showing

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.820
others that they are healthy people with good habits.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.595
Finally, in an environment where hand-washing is required,

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:07.400
such as a food worker or a doctor at a hospital,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.100
there might be an emotional fear of being reprimanded for

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.150
not hand-washing that motivates the hand washer to perform the act.
