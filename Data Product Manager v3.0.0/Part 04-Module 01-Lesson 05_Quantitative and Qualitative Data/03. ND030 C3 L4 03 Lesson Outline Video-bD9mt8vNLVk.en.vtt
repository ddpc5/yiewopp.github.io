00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
In this lesson, we'll first discuss

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.460
the differences between quantitative and qualitative data,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.585
and then learn about the benefits and drawbacks of each data type.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.445
In the next part of this lesson,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.469
we'll discuss how to integrate qualitative data into the iterative design process,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.660
including learning the parts of the cycle of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.845
iterative design that most benefit from qualitative research.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:24.990
In the third part of this lesson,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.160
we'll cover three of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.980
the most common qualitative research methods used

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.905
by product managers today: focus groups,

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.860
user interviews, and usability testing.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.800
In the fourth part of this lesson,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.605
we'll discuss using the jobs-to-be-done theory to

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:43.285
understand customers true motivations for using our product.

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.255
Analyzing the job that customers hire our product to perform

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:52.225
provides great evidence for the types of new product features that will find success.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:55.160
Finally, in the last part of this lesson,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.710
we'll discuss how to use the RICE framework to

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.135
prioritize between different product improvement ideas.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.800
Product managers often face stakeholders with

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.170
competing concerns and ideas about the most important next step for a product.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.170
The RICE framework provides a quantifiable way to decide how to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.070
choose the next feature to build as part of an iterative cycle of design.
