00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
A job map breaks down the steps a customer's taking while trying to get a job done.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.645
A good job map is solution-agnostic.

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:09.525
That is as much as possible,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.660
it should describe what the customer is trying to fulfill,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.440
independent of what they are using or doing to get the job done.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.290
For example, a job map would not contain a step where users click on a button,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.450
because clicking on a button is a specific solution

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.855
and doesn't describe the ultimate goal the customer is trying to accomplish,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.430
when clicking on that button.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.130
Instead, a step in the job map might be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.280
checking whether the price of a product fits their budget.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.220
Job maps offer a way to outline

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.285
the ideal process flow for the needs each customer is trying to fulfill.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.095
By creating a job map,

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:46.880
product managers often find ideas and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.135
areas for optimization and improvement of a product,

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:53.510
as well as opportunities for new products or features that may

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.430
address the customer's job to be done in a more efficient manner.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.120
A job map contains eight steps,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170
each step in the process may reveal opportunities to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.130
innovate and improve the solution currently offered by a product.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.535
The first step is definition.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.790
The define step is where the job executor

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.270
defines their goals and the resources needed for achieving these goals.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.110
For example, a carpenter building a shelf might realize he needs a shorter piece of wood,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.900
and that one way to accomplish the goal of having a functional shelf,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.470
would be to cut a longer piece of wood.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.120
When reviewing this step in a job map,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.360
product managers can improve their product by making planning simpler for the user.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.895
The second step in the job map is location.

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.395
In the locate step,

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:46.295
a job executor gathers everything they need to accomplish a job,

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:49.135
whether physical tools or information.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:52.895
For example, the carpenter in our shelf building example,

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:54.860
would need to gather the wood to be cut,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.375
a saw, a measuring tape, and safety equipment.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:01.715
A product manager can innovate in this step by making it

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.585
easier for a user to gather everything they need in one place.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:09.035
The third step in the job map is preparation.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:10.580
During the prepare step,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.545
a job executor sets up their environment to be ready to do a job.

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:17.180
Think of a data entry worker ensuring

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.030
their monitor and keyboard are in the right position,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.540
so that they can type all day without hurting their neck or back.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.380
For example, the carpenter would need to put on safety goggles

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.850
and ear protection and measure and mark the wood at the proper length for cutting.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.550
To make improvements in the prepare step,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.850
product managers can reduce the required setup or

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.570
provide guidance that allows users to prepare more quickly.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.175
The fourth step in the job map is the confirm step,

00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:47.900
confirmation is when a job executor does

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.915
a final check to make sure they are ready to do a job.

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:54.200
For example, the carpenter might double-check the link they

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.790
measured on the wood fits the length needed for the shelf.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.610
Companies can innovate during the confirmation step by giving

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.605
users easy ways to confirm their readiness for a job to be done.

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:08.990
The fifth step in a job map is execution.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.075
Execution is the step where a job executor actually begins to carry out a job.

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.715
For example, the carpenter in our example

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:19.670
would begin to cut his piece of wood in this step,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.360
a product manager improves the execution step by removing

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.340
blockers and ensuring their product is intuitive to use.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.815
The sixth step in the job map is monitoring.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.420
In the monitoring step,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.880
the job executor checks to see whether

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.170
the job they are doing is being successfully carried out.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.660
For example, a carpenter will check as he is cutting

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.035
the wood that it is still lined up to the proper measurement,

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:48.460
and that the cut is going straight across the piece of wood.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.980
For this step, product managers can innovate by giving

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.370
users more information about progress towards their goal.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.515
The penultimate step in the job map,

00:03:57.515 --> 00:04:00.080
step 7 is the modification step.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.565
In the modify step,

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:07.040
a job executor might make changes or adjustments to improve the outcomes of the job.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.180
For example, a carpenter might readjust his saw or wood,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.280
if he noticed in the monitoring step,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.580
that the cut was veering away from straight.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.630
To improve a product in this step,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.210
a product manager should look to reduce the number of

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.860
modifications a user has to make when executing a job.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.960
Finally, the eighth step in the job map is conclusion.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.345
In the conclude step,

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:32.435
the job executor finishes executing the job.

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:37.130
For example, the carpenter completes his wood cutting and has a smaller piece of wood,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.420
which is the correct thing to be used for the shelf he desired.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.935
To improve a product in the conclusion step,

00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:47.370
product managers can decrease the work needed to conclude a job.
