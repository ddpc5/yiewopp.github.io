00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
Product managers must make choices about which new features to prioritize.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:08.010
There will almost always be more ideas to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.235
improve a product than time and engineering resources,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.190
so a product manager must be ruthless in making

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.895
choices about where to focus a team's efforts and time.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:22.590
One way of approaching the issue of prioritization is by using a framework,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.780
like the RICE framework to determine

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.095
the order in which new feature should be prioritized.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.450
Prioritization of new features can

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.885
sometimes be the biggest challenge product managers face.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:39.375
One difficulty product managers face is the desire to focus on new exciting ideas.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:43.415
While sometimes the new exciting ideas are the right features to focus on,

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:48.485
other times, more traditional and established changes may provide a greater lift.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.230
Another reality that product managers face is

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.015
different stakeholders may have pet ideas that appeal to their particular use cases.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:00.395
Perhaps the head of sales has recently talked to a client that asked for feature A,

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.390
while the head of development cares more about

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.605
technical debt in the product and wants to spend time on that.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:08.375
Even if stakeholders don't have pet ideas,

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.965
they still won't always agree on what features are the most important.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.870
Stakeholders have different perspectives on a project,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.560
and may even be pursuing different KPIs.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.000
So the features each wants to prioritize will not always be the same.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.750
A prioritization framework provides a common language for discussing features.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.145
By using a framework,

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.710
stakeholders and product managers can prioritize

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.320
features in a manner that is consistent and fair.
