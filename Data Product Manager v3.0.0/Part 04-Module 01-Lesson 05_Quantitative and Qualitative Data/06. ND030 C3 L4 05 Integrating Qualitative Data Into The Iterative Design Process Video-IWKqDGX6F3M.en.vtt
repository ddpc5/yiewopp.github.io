00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.415
A cycle of quantitative and qualitative data is often observed in product management.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:09.000
First, analyzing usage data, conversion funnels,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.120
and other quantitative data collected by a product can

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.065
reveal users or areas that are under, or overperforming.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:20.325
Next, upon seeing a problem with quantitative analysis,

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:23.235
product managers then turn to user interviews or

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:28.620
other qualitative data techniques to understand why such trends might be occurring.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.835
By combining the power of quantitative and qualitative data,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.700
a product manager is equipped to hypothesize

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.325
why a trend is occurring and what change could address it.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.990
The product manager can then run experiments to confirm the hypothesis.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.835
As the product manager reviews the quantitative data

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.530
associated with the experiment, the cycle restarts.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.160
Consider the example in the last section of an app who's

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.815
usage began to go down among 18-25-year-olds.

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:01.085
First, the quantitative data of app usage

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:05.170
revealed the trend and the severity of the decline in app usage.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.385
Second, the qualitative data produced from user interviews help product managers

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:12.830
understand why the decline might be occurring

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.175
because younger users wanted the video chat option.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:21.830
Together, the data could lead a product manager to ideas about how to increase usage,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.890
such as introducing a new video chat feature.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.170
Finally, by running an experiment,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.070
a product manager could confirm the validity of the hypothesis.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.200
The cycle of qualitative and quantitative data is ongoing.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240
For a data product manager at any given time,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.925
multiple versions of this cycle might be running

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:43.760
in different stages for different parts of the product.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.160
This is because the cycle is itself part of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.505
iterative design and the cycle of design thinking.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:53.180
When we discussed the design thinking cycle in lesson 1,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.785
we learned that there are three stages and six steps in the cycle.

00:01:56.785 --> 00:02:01.040
Let's revisit these stages and steps with a focus on what type of data,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.975
qualitative or quantitative, is most likely to be useful.

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:08.585
The first stage in the cycle is understanding users.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:14.240
This includes empathizing with users by researching their wants and needs.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.340
During the understand stage,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.650
and especially in the empathize stage,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.515
qualitative research is often employed because

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:25.645
understanding a user's wants and needs requires qualitative data.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.880
By speaking with customers or potential customers,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.340
product managers and researchers can gather

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.405
the qualitative data that allows them to empathize with the user.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.205
After the empathize step,

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:43.490
the next step is defined or combining all research to define a user's problems.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.335
When defining a problem,

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:48.815
qualitative and quantitative data might both be considered,

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:53.600
especially if a product manager is improving an existing product by looking at

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.520
usage data and combining this with qualitative data gathered at the empathize step.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.430
A product manager can start to narrow down the problem they're looking to solve.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.610
After the understand stage,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.370
comes the explorer stage,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.590
which is where different ideas for meeting a user's needs are explored.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.050
The first step in explore is ideation,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.580
which is when product managers and designers can think broadly and generate

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.500
a large list of potential ideas that they might build to meet the user needs.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.110
Once many ideas have been generated,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.140
a few that seem like a best fit can be prototyped.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.020
The time spent in the prototype stage usually

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380
directly correlates to the size of the proposed change.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.635
Then it enters the materialized phase.

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:43.580
The first step in the materialize phase is to test the change.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.910
The testing phase may include getting feedback on the prototype

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.720
from actual users through focus groups and usability testing.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.900
By observing actual users interact with a prototype,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.110
product managers and designers can get data that allows

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.715
them to make adjustments to a new feature before going live.

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:04.970
After usability testing or if the change is a smaller, simple one,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.830
the testing step includes

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.975
running experiments by exposing some live users to the new feature.

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:14.435
These tests include A/B tests or multivariate tests,

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:17.110
which we'll explore further in the next lesson.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.700
By testing the feature with live users,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.160
product managers can use quantitative data to

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.910
confirm the effect of the new feature on the product, KPIs.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.240
Finally, after testing the new designer feature is implemented for all users.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640
With the feature launched,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.975
a product manager can continue to analyze usage data,

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:39.290
conversion funnels, and other quantitative information

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.860
to find users or areas that are under and overperforming.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.155
With this, the cycle begins again.

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:47.810
Throughout the cycle, product managers leverage

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.090
qualitative and quantitative data to drive

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.315
the creation of the most appealing product for users.

00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:56.210
By following the complete cycle and gathering

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.990
qualitative data to understand the quantitative trends observed,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.930
the solutions the product management team proposes

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.870
are likely to be more successful because they will be

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.035
targeted to address the users motivations and feelings

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:13.500
instead of addressing and assume problem that may not exist.
