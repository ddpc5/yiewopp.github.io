00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
First, let's discuss quantitative data,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.930
including the benefits and drawbacks of using this type of data.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.965
Quantitative data is any data that expresses account,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.400
amount, or range in a numeric fashion.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.870
Quantitative data can be used to answer questions like how many,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.230
how often, and how much.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.920
Examples of quantitative data would be the count of visitors

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.000
to a website or the percent of customers who use a feature.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.685
Collecting quantitative data provides a great number of benefits to product managers,

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:39.505
but quantitative data also has limitations.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.860
A major benefit of quantitative data is that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.285
quantitative data provides descriptive measurements of how a product is used,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:52.165
such as the number of users and the number of times those users perform an action.

00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:55.190
As discussed when looking at segment analysis,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.160
quantitative data also allows product managers to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.735
analyze data for trends and differences between groups.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.210
Quantitative data also has major drawbacks.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.345
The biggest drawback is that quantitative data can't tell us why a user took an action,

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.050
only that they did.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440
This means that when quantitative data is examined,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.775
there can be many interpretations for the cause of the recorded trends.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:26.635
For example, imagine an app who's usage begins to go down among 18-25 year olds.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.155
Analyzing quantitative data reveals this trend.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.770
But quantitative data can't explain why the trend is occurring,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.440
or what a product can do to change this trend.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.960
For that, a product manager often turns to qualitative data.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.700
Qualitative data is any data that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.215
expresses the qualities or characteristics of something.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:51.440
In product research, qualitative data often focuses on

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.080
human behavior and needs that can't simply be quantified by measuring user actions.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.230
Qualitative data is often collected by talking to actual users or potential users,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
often in interviews and focus groups.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.060
Examples of the type of

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.875
qualitative information product managers collect includes customer use cases,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.095
pain points experienced by users,

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:20.215
and the opinions and preferences of a user towards a potential feature or product.

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:25.145
Collecting qualitative data provides a great number of benefits to product managers.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.505
But qualitative data also has its limitations.

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:32.960
A major benefit of qualitative data is that it provides insight

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.900
into why a user has done something or might be interested in a certain feature.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.745
Qualitative data gives product managers access to a richer understanding of user wants,

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:48.305
desires, and concerns, that can guide them as they improve their product.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:51.565
Qualitative data also has major drawbacks.

00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:55.940
Because collecting qualitative data often requires talking to users,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.325
the process of collecting qualitative data is much more time-consuming.

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.630
While quantitative data might be collected

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.645
automatically by your product as customers use it,

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.820
most qualitative data will require

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.320
conversations which take time to analyze and interpret.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.415
Those some qualitative data can be quantified.

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:18.740
For example, you can count the number of users who are satisfied with your product.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.440
Larger themes around customer needs and desires are often difficult to quantify.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.800
Since qualitative data is time consuming to collect,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.620
product managers often have to form hypotheses

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.800
from only a handful of qualitative data points.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.750
To add onto this issue,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.980
qualitative data has an inherent risk of inaccuracy.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.370
Sometimes customers will tell you what they think you want to hear.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.885
Even if customers tell you exactly what they think their motivations are,

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:51.095
many people don't know why they make the choices they do.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:56.045
So qualitative data, especially when focusing on what a person might do,

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:58.805
must be considered with a grain of salt.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.620
Let's revisit our earlier example of an app

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.575
whose usage began to go down among 18-25 year olds.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.920
By interviewing users and former users in that age group,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.240
product managers might get feedback that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.260
the apps newest chat release doesn't allow video conversations anymore,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.420
which is important to this demographic.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.870
Understanding the why could help lead product managers to

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.220
new feature ideas to increase their apps appeal to 18-25 year olds.
