Hi everyone and welcome to lesson 4.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.510
Today, we're going to be talking about segment analysis,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.760
including how to divide users into

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.330
cohorts or segments that share similar characteristics,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.205
how do identify attributes in your data for use in user segment analysis,

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.960
and how to apply cohort and segment analysis to funnel and feature usage.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320
By looking at product data broken into user segments,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.200
we'll identify opportunities to engage and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.545
improve user experience for different types of users.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.650
Using data to identify areas for improvement

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.590
is an important step in a cycle of iterative design.
