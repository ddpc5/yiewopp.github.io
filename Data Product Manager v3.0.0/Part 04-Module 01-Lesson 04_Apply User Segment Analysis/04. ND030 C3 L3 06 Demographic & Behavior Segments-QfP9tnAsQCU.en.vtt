00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
The second type of user segmentation we're going to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.135
cover is segmenting users by shared demographics.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:10.020
Segmenting users based on demographics means analyzing

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.205
data for groups of users that share the same personal characteristics.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.205
Some example demographics would be age,

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.950
income, location, and gender.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.090
Product managers use demographic segmentation to understand if

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.845
the personal characteristics of their users result in different product experiences.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.110
Customers with demographics might have

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.175
different needs that impact the way they use a product.

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:37.020
For example, men using an app that tracks

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.000
user weight might be more interested in a feature that tracks weight gain,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.350
such as muscle gain,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.570
then female users who tend to only want to track weight loss.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.970
Another example would be if lower-income buyers of a product needed

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.715
more reassurance of a guaranteed return policy

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.705
than higher income users before purchasing.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:59.000
Of course, these are only hypotheses about

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.900
how different demographic segments might interact with the product or feature.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.350
Only by reviewing segmented data can product managers

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.220
understand whether there is a difference between demographic segments?

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.800
When significant differences emerge,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.440
product managers can form a hypothesis for

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.460
the cause of these results and then investigate further.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.305
Such investigations often lead to discoveries

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.130
about unmet needs of the underperforming segment.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.064
These unmet needs become opportunities to boost KPIs with targeted product changes.

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:34.385
Once a product manager identifies a user characteristic of interest,

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.825
they still need to break down those segments into different groups.

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:41.420
Some segments had dividing lines that are commonly used,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.950
such as female, male,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.525
and other for gender.

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:49.910
Other divisions may depend on the actual data and the type of customer being served.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.540
Take for example, segments of age.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.870
Imagine a reading app that wants to compare segments of customers by age.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.270
A typical app serving an average adult population might divide its users by decades,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.715
a commonly used division when considering age bands as a user segment.

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:08.825
In another instance, however,

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.620
a product manager might divide age into smaller segments.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.245
In a children's learning app, for example,

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:18.700
users might be divided into segments of only a few years,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.395
since young children's learning needs change rapidly,

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:24.320
smaller age segments would make more sense than

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.905
the traditional decade divisions used in the book reading app.

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.650
These examples serve to show that the way you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.425
divide segments as a product manager might vary.

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:34.625
As a product manager,

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.700
you will look at the data of actual users by trying

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.925
different divisions and considering the customers you serve,

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:44.730
you will know which segment divisions make sense for your product.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.730
The third and final type of user segmentation that we'll cover in

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.960
this section is segmenting users who share similar behaviors.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.250
Segmenting users based on behaviors means analyzing data for groups

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.525
of users that use your product behave in similar ways.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:06.685
Some examples would be whether a customer makes use of a specific feature,

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.890
how active the customer is,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.325
such as how many times a day a user logs in on average,

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:16.180
and the device with which customers are accessing the product.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.050
A user who uses a software only from their mobile device will have

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.505
a very different experience than a user who exclusively logs in on their desktop.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:27.190
A user who accesses a program every day,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.500
will have a very different experience and likely a different reaction to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.795
new features than a user who only logs in every couple weeks.

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:39.545
Different behaviors indicate that customers might have different motivations and needs.

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:43.460
Segmenting users based on their behaviors allows us to find patterns

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.210
in the data about how our product is succeeding or failing,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.195
specific types of users.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:53.390
Cohort analysis and behavioral information about users will come

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.895
naturally from the instrumentation you'll have put in place to track user actions.

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:02.045
In order to analyze products using demographic information however,

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:05.555
you're going to need data about your users in your database.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:10.735
This may mean asking users to fill out profiles or answer questions about themselves.

00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:14.390
A note of caution when seeking information on users.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.940
First, make it clear to users why providing the information will be valuable to them.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.955
For example, users who share their location

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:26.200
will get location-based alerts when they're near a store.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.200
Customers don't want to just handover information about themselves.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.920
You have a duty to provide value to the user if you think them

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.035
sharing that information will be helpful in your work to make a better product.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:40.310
A classic example of information that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.330
most product managers can't ask their users for is user income.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.195
Though this data could be very helpful in segmenting,

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:50.840
most people consider that question personal and private.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.930
If you managed a product like a retirement planning app,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.375
however, such a question would seem relevant to a user and might be answered.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:03.080
Otherwise, asking for sensitive data like this is more likely to lose you a user,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.770
than gain you information to segment with.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.440
Finally, when collecting user demographic information,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.630
keep in mind that consumer privacy laws,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.090
such as the General Data Protection Regulation,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.180
GDPR in Europe, and the California Consumer

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.750
Privacy Act CCPA for any users from California,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.725
give users many rights with regards to their personal information.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.465
As a product manager,

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:29.300
you'll need to ensure the data you collect is stored and

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.350
shared in such a way that your customers can easily forbid its sale,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.420
review all the personal information you've

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.840
collected and request all personal information be deleted.
