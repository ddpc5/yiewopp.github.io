00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
When analyzing product performance,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.900
it is often helpful to break down customers into different segments.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.145
A user segment is a group of users that share something in common.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:15.675
Not all customers use our product in the same way or for the same reason.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.660
Breaking down data analysis by user segment,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.030
provides valuable information about how

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.555
features appeal to certain types of users over others.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.130
As a product manager,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.355
we often have access to a lot of data about our users.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.215
When thinking about how to segment that user data,

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.050
we can consider three main categories.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.610
First, we can segment users by

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.570
their acquisition date or when they started using a product or feature.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.795
This is often referred to as cohort analysis.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.330
A cohort is a group of users who share

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.440
a common experience of starting the use of a product at around the same time.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.640
Second, we can segment users by demographic similarities.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
Demographics are anything that describe a user as a person,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.150
such as age and gender.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.320
The third type of segment is based on a user's behavior when using a product or feature,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.200
such as being a low or high use customer.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.740
By analyzing data via the lens of customer segments,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.845
we can find where different segments perform differently.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.595
When certain user segments perform above or below average,

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:23.075
this provides hints about areas for further research.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:26.360
While user segmentation can provide a great starting place

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780
that sets us on the path to discovery of product opportunities,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.290
a note of caution is appropriate here.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.570
Just because segments differ in performance does not mean

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.605
the distinction between the segments is the cause of the difference in performance.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:44.330
Segment analysis provides insight that helps product managers decide what elements of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.970
the product and the customer experience might be most

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.790
valuable to research and experiment upon further.
