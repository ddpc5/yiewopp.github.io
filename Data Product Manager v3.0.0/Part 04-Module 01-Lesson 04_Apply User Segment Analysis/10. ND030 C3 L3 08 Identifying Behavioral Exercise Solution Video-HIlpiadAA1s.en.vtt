00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Question 1 asks us to identify potential user segments in the data file.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.245
I've uploaded the data into Tableau,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.930
so we can quickly review the dimensions to locate

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.785
potential user information that can be used for segmentation.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:17.115
In this file, we see dimensions such as user Id,

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.440
date, device, and sex.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.550
User Id the user's Id not a segment.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.670
They could be the date that a user was first seen.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.440
Good for cohort analysis.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.455
Device and sex also sound like user characteristics that can be used for segmentation.

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:39.810
Date, device, and sex are the potential user segments in the data file.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.980
Question 2 asks us to list all divisions within

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.580
each characteristic or user behavior segment in the dataset.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.430
Let me go to the workbook.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.375
By placing a dimension from the table into a column or row in Tableau,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.575
the number of unique names per dimension will be shown.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:59.730
The sex segment is female and male.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.275
The division for devices is desktop and mobile,

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:06.200
and the division for date includes January,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.505
February, March, and April of 2015.

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:13.970
The final question asks us to calculate the largest and smallest segments.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.280
To do this, we need to look at the unique user Ids associated with each segment.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.980
Starting with sex output and a measure of the number of records,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.675
we see we have 45,000 in each.

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:29.730
For desktop and mobile,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.190
we have 60,000 and 30,000,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.605
and for dates we have 22,600.

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:40.145
The largest group is desktop users,

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:43.570
who represent 60,200 users.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.480
The smallest segment group is the monthly segments at 22,600 records per month.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.925
If we're considering just user traits,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.325
the smallest group would be mobile,

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:59.160
with 30,200 mobile records.
