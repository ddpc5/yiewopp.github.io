00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Segment analysis can be applied to general feature usage metrics.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.440
In this section, we'll discuss how applying segment level analysis to feature

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.885
level metrics can reveal differences in feature usage among users segment groups.

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:17.835
As with final analysis,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.390
segmentation can be applied to feature usage metrics.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.770
Segmentation, a feature usage data shows whether a feature is being

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.575
adopted at the same rate and used in the same manner by different types of users.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.090
Different patterns of feature adoption might reflect a feature

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.980
that only appeals to a particular type of customer use case.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.810
Differences in feature used among segment groups

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.719
can lead to a realization that a features benefits,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.605
need to be made more appealing to the under using segment group.

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.725
An example of how segmentation can be important

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:55.310
is if we were to segment the usage of a feature by device type.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.930
The overall metrics might tell us that 60 percent of customers use the feature,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.480
but segmenting that data could show 80 percent of

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.625
mobile users and only 20 percent of desktop users use the feature.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:09.830
Since the usage is not the same across device types,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.930
there could be something about how the feature works

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.410
that isn't appealing to desktop users.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.170
A difference between the segment groups means product managers might want to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.610
research and run tests to understand why such a division is occurring.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.505
It is also worth noting that feature usage itself can be a behavioral segment.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:31.940
KPIs from customers that use a feature can be compared to those that don't,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.800
or customers that use a feature with

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.465
a certain frequency can be compared to those that use the feature less frequently.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:42.230
For example, imagine comparing the average retention of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.040
users who favorite items to those who don't favorite items.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.870
If a user who favorites items uses the app for an average of four weeks,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.460
but users who don't favorite items use the app for only an average of two weeks,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.275
this might be a sign that the favoriting feature helps user retention.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:02.400
Of course, correlation is not causation.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.560
It is just as likely that highly engaged users who would already have been

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.940
retained for longer are also the users that make use of the favoriting feature.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.700
Knowing this difference between segments simply provides

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
the launching point for further user research and analysis,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.910
as part of the cycle of iterative product design.
