00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
we learned that funnel analysis is a great technique to

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.810
identify areas where users drop off in pursuit of a goal.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.930
Breaking funnel analysis done by user segments

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.650
allows product managers to dig even deeper into that data.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
A product manager who performs such analysis will likely learn

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.980
valuable information about how to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
optimize a product's features for different types of users.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.600
Segment analysis of funnels follows four basic steps.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.750
First, you must create the overall funnel.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.065
Just like we discussed in the last lesson,

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:40.430
you will need to determine the steps users take towards achieving the goal,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.450
and count the number of users who complete each step.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.715
Next, as discussed in the previous section,

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.910
you'll need to determine which user segments are available in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.345
the data that you think might perform differently in the funnel.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.910
These user segments are the ones you will apply to the funnel analysis.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.845
The third step of segment analysis of a funnel

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.925
is to recreate the funnel for each group within a segment.

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:07.355
For example, how many users on a mobile device completed

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:11.135
each step versus how many users on a tablet completed each step,

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:14.360
versus how many users on a desktop completed each step.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.355
By generating this information,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.105
you will have the data necessary to compare user experiences.

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.655
The final step is to analyze the data

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:25.010
to look for groups within a segment that dropped out of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
the funnel or on a particular step in the funnel at

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.465
a rate that is noticeably higher or lower than average.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:35.530
If the segment you're analyzing doesn't impact how users complete the funnel,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.230
there might not be any difference in the drop off rates among segment groups.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.870
For example, men and women may use a feature in

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.385
the same way with no difference in outcome between gender.

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:50.420
Not every difference between users will result in a different style of using a product.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.830
But if a particular group of users isn't getting the experience they need,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.865
this will likely be reflected in a dropout rate that is higher than average.

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.069
Once such a pattern is identified,

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.880
you can talk to those users and run experiments to find ways to optimize

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.990
the user experience and boost funnel conversion for all user segments.
