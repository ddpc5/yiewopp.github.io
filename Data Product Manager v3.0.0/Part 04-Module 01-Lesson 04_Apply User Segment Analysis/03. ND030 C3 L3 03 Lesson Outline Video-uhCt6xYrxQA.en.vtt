00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
In this lesson, we'll first learn what user behaviors and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.875
characteristics often lead to different product and feature usage patterns,

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.590
and discuss how those types of user behaviors and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.740
characteristics can be used in segment analysis.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.420
Identifying potential segments of interest in a data provides product managers

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.175
the information we need to apply a user segment view to our analysis.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:25.100
In the second part of this lesson,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.015
we'll learn how to apply segment analysis to user conversion funnels.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:32.540
We'll discuss what data patterns provide evidence that cohorts are

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.605
performing differently and when further research would be a good next step.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.245
In the third and final part of this lesson,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:44.110
we'll learn how to apply user segment analysis to the analysis of feature usage.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.920
As with funnel analysis,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.170
we'll discuss what data patterns provide

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.685
evidence that different types of users are performing differently.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.810
We'll learn when further research at

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.530
a user segment level would be a good next step for improving a feature.
