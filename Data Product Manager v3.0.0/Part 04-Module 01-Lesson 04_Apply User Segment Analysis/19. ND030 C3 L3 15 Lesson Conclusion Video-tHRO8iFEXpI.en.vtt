00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
Congratulations, you have just finished the fourth lesson in this course.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
In this lesson, we learned how to apply user segment analysis,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.055
to reveal opportunities, to optimize our products for different types of users.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.155
In the first section of this lesson,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.765
we discussed different types of user segments.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:23.490
We learned how to break down users into smaller groups based on their start date,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.204
their demographics, and their behavior.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.785
We also examined why different user types

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.740
might show different performance on key metrics.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.435
In the second section,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:38.190
we learned how to apply segment analysis to funnel analysis in Tableau.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.760
Finally, in the third part of this lesson,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.320
we learned how to use segment analysis when reviewing feature usage data.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.610
By adding segment analysis to feature and funnel analysis,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.185
we learned a valuable skill that helps product managers identify areas

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:58.900
where a product can be improved to better appeal to different kinds of users.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.775
Segment analysis is part of the cycle of iterative data-driven design.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:06.260
Analyzing segment data can show

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.145
product managers areas that need further research to improve.

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:12.335
Research leads to experiments,

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:14.930
and experiments provide more data that can be

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.830
used to continue the process of optimization.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.550
Congratulations on completing this lesson,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.330
and see you in the next lesson: quantitative and qualitative data.
