00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
For this exercise, you are asked to segment the usage of

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.445
a new feature of play a random song launched by a music app.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:14.205
Question 1, assess to determine the number of first-time users that use each feature.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.720
Looking at the data file,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.715
we can see three event types.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:20.040
Banding page, play random song,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.675
and play requested song.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.440
We know that the new feature of the music app was

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
the ability for new users to play a random song.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.305
So all play random song event types

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:33.650
likely represent a user making use of this new feature.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.380
In contrast, the play requested song,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.950
represents the new user using the original feature set.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.025
To see the number of users using each feature,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:47.015
one has to count the number of records associated with each event type.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.190
Since these are first-time users,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.620
there will only be one session ID for every user ID, and vice versa.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.945
By counting the unique number of user IDs associated with it two event types in tablo,

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:02.760
we can see that 1,709 users played

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.095
a random song and only 1,045 users played a specific song during their first visit.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:13.580
The second question of the exercise was to use available user demographics or

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.225
behavior segments to see if the use of the feature varied among different types of users.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.660
The data provides three potential elements of behavioral distinction.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920
Gender, device, and date.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.690
By looking at the count of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.835
requested and random events broken down into these cohorts or segments,

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:38.695
we can calculate the percent of use of each feature for each group.

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:41.140
First, let's look at gender.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.935
As seen in this table,

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:48.350
both genders play a random song and about the same ratio to playing of a requested song.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.380
67-69 percent of females and males played random song,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.040
and 32-30 percent requested.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.755
The new random song feature doesn't seem to be appealing more to either gender.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.385
Now let's talk about devices.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:07.775
Again, similar ratios are seen among all devices.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:12.580
It looks like both features are equally effective across all devices.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.000
Finally, let's check the daily use of features to see if any changes or

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.110
marketing resulted in a spike of the usage of one feature on a particular day.
