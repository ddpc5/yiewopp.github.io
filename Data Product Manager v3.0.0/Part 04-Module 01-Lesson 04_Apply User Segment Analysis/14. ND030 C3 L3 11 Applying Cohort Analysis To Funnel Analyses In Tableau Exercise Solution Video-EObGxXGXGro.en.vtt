00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
For this exercise, you are asked to segment the drop

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.195
off rate between pages on buy stuff.com.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.600
Question number 1 asked you to determine the drop off rate

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.275
at each step in the buy things.com e-commerce bundle.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.990
To see the drop off between pages, first,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.600
we need to look at the pages and order

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.795
them as a user would experience them in the funnel.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.035
In buy stuff.com, the funnel is between the pages;

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.880
homepage, search page, the payment page,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.070
the payment confirmation page.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.915
After we've ordered the pages,

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.030
we need to count the number of distinct events on each page.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.300
Because this website has a simple flow,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.570
every page is required of the user to complete a purchase.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.450
Therefore, every page will be shown in the funnel,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.695
and every page represents a user taking a new action.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:53.390
Here is a count of every user who made it to each page in the funnel.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.340
To calculate the actual drop off,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.980
we can use a Quick Table Calculation of percent difference.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.425
This shows us the percent change between counts.

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:06.760
Now, we can see the drop off rate between all steps.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.490
We can move to question 2,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.035
determine funnel conversion by user segment for devices, sexes, and months.

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:15.440
To segment the data,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.050
we need to add a segment group to the rows to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.650
determine a drop off rate for a given behavior and characteristic.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.100
Let's start with sex.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.080
Question 2 also asked which segments have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.395
a higher average drop off rate between steps and other users,

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:33.185
and what such a drop off rate could indicate.

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:34.999
For males and females,

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.650
there is no real difference in drop off rate between steps,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.040
49 percent versus 50 percent.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.330
In the first step, 86 percent and 92 percent.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.930
This indicates gender may not play a role

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.825
in whether a new user completes the shopping flow.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.020
Now, let's look at device.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.535
When we look at the device drop off rates,

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:57.650
we can see that desktop users have

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.705
a 10 percent higher drop off rate between the search and payment pages,

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:05.375
90 percent drop off on desktop versus 80 percent on mobile.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.210
They also have a five percent higher drop off

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.345
rate between the payment and payment confirmation pages.

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:15.350
This may indicate areas for Desktop Experience Optimization.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.825
Finally, let's look at months.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.180
When looking at these drop off rates,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.125
there is a large increase in drop off between landing and search pages,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.525
which can be seen when comparing January and February to March and April,

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:34.805
drop off increases from about 40 percent to about 60 percent between the two pages.

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:39.230
Similarly, the drop off rate between search and payment pages

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.965
increases 10 percent from around 82 percent to around 92 percent.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.750
This indicates a change occurred between February and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.185
March that is impacting the new user funnel conversion.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:55.655
The CEO should examine what changes occurred between February and March.

00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:58.250
Perhaps a new feature introduced a bug or

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.180
a new marketing method is recruiting more users who are less likely to purchase.
