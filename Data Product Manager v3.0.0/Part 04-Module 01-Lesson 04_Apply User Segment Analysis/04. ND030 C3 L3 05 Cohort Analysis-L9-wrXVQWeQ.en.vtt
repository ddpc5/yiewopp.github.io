00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
The first type of user segmentation and one of the most common in

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.445
segmentation is the date at which a user began using a product.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:13.740
Segmentation based on user acquisition date is also called cohort analysis.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
A cohort is a group of people with a shared experience,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
meaning they started using the same product around the same time.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040
This could be as broad as the group of users who

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.500
started using an app on any mobile device in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.020
June or as specific as the users who

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.380
started using an app on an Apple device last Tuesday.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.960
When segmenting users into cohorts,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.845
you should consider the pace at which changes are made in your product.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:42.320
For products where marketing channels and new features are introduced every few days,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.155
a daily view might be a helpful comparison.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.285
As the pace of change slows,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.330
the cohort groups can widen to new users in a week,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.325
month, or even a quarter.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.580
You can use a cohort analysis to try to isolate

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.790
the effect of marketing modification on user behavior.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.660
For example, if you look at users who visited a website for

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.985
the first time in June and see 30 percent of those visitors went on to make a purchase,

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.510
and compare the June cohort with the visitors in August and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.175
find 50 percent of those visitors went on to make a purchase,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:20.255
this is a sign that the website is getting better at converting visitors into customers.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.690
The reason for this difference will require more investigation.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.140
The change might be due to different marketing strategies or

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.795
changes made to the website to encourage purchases or both.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.424
By noting the difference between the two cohorts,

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:37.405
product managers can measure the effect of cumulative changes over time.

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:42.005
You can see that since groups of users in a cohort share the same experience,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.430
the difference in KPI's,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.490
such as conversion rate across different cohorts may point to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.740
a change that impacted user experience for better or worse.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.945
As cohort analysis deal with groups over time,

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:55.460
the format for analyzing

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.510
a cohort analysis is a little different than other segment analysis.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.995
Generally, a cohort analysis will list the cohorts as rows.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.860
Take users visiting a website as an example.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.190
In this chart, November 3rd, 2nd,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.845
October 31st, on the left-hand side,

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.895
is the day a user first arrived on the website.

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.200
On the top, day with 0, 1, 2,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.460
3 shows the number of days since the user was first seen.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.045
The percentage shows the percent of users that took a desired action over time,

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:30.605
in our example, visiting the website.

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:34.925
On day 0, all users in their cohorts landed on the website.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.670
The percentage of them taking the desired action of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.185
visiting the website is 100 percent for all cohorts.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:46.115
Of the 3,500 users who visited the site for the first time on November 3rd,

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:50.260
39 percent of them were seeing again two days after their first visit.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.550
To better view the percentage drop off,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.635
the chart is usually color-coded.

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:56.285
The darker the boxes,

00:02:56.285 --> 00:03:00.865
the higher the percentage of users from the cohort that returned on the day in question.

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:04.400
The classic cohort analysis shows user retention or

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.045
the percent of users who complete a desired action on one day,

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:11.455
and on the next, and the next after that, and so forth.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:13.565
By looking at this cohort analysis,

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:17.945
we can see if there are differences in retention rates among those of different cohorts.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:19.460
If a difference is seen,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.285
this may mean something about the users or the product has changed.

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:27.500
Cohort analysis can be used to examine metrics other than retention.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.270
Here, we see an example of an e-commerce site that is tracking a user cohort by

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.255
day in order to see how many days it typically takes for a user to make a purchase.

00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:40.070
By looking for the dark blue areas which indicate

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.820
a higher percent of users took the desired action of making a purchase,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.115
we can see that most users make a purchase about 2-3 days from first visiting the site.

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:52.175
It also looks like the most recent cohorts,

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:56.615
those users who visited the site for the first time on October 14th and 15th,

00:03:56.615 --> 00:04:01.030
have a higher purchase rates on day 0 and 1 than other cohorts.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.960
Such data provides evidence to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.140
a product manager that a change might have been made around

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.030
October 18th that had the positive result of more visitors making purchases sooner.
