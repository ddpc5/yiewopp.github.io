00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
User segment analysis allows product managers

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.825
to look at data from the perspective of different types of customers.

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:10.890
Users segments are groups of users that share a similar characteristic.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.675
A user segment can be based on when the user started a product,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.810
user demographics such as age and gender,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
behavioral characteristics such as how often a site is visited,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.855
or even variable user characteristics such as the device used when accessing a software.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:33.290
When product data is only evaluated for all users together regardless of segment,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.325
product managers lose valuable information.

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.505
Users are not all the same,

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.395
and segment analysis allows us to find patterns in the data

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.570
about how our product is succeeding or failing specific types of users.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.640
User segment analysis helps us find places where

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.045
a product or feature works better for some than others.

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:58.070
The findings from analyzing data in this way often drive further research that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.020
leads to optimizations enabling

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.020
the product to better appeal to user segments of interest.
