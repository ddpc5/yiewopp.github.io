00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
In Tableau, I have synced data on the use of

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.240
an attendance tracker in a software used by teachers.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.130
First, I will examine the number of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.325
feature users compared to the number of product users.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:16.530
By pulling at the attendance tracking feature usage and product usage numbers into rows,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.760
I can see 40 out of the 70 product customers have used the attendance feature.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.030
That is a large percent of customers,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.920
but let's see if the different user segments use the feature at the same frequency.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.350
In our dataset, we have job dimension,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.170
which indicates whether a user teaches elementary school or middle school.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.120
By dragging this job dimension onto the sheet,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.920
I can compare the usage of the feature in these two different demographics.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.990
Now we can see that 20 out of 30 or two-thirds of elementary school teachers,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.840
but only 20 out of 40 or one-half

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.875
of middle school teachers are using our attendance feature.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.770
Perhaps the way attendance is typically taken varies by school type,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.005
and the current attendance feature aligns better to elementary school teacher usage.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.655
Now that we've identified the difference in the data,

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.560
we can talk with customers and run

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.815
experiments to determine why feature usage is different,

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:12.030
and ways to improve it.
