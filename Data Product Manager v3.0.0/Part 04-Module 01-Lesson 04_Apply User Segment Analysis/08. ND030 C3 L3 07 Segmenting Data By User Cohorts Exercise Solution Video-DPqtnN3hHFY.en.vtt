00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
Question 1 asks you to list three potential users segments of interest for Food Fast.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.730
There are many many behavioral and user characteristics that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.930
might impact how a customer uses a food delivery app like Food Fast.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.765
Demographic divisions, such as age,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.780
occupation, and location might come to mind.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.000
Behavioral characteristics such as the frequency with which orders are placed on the app,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.225
the time of day which a user typically logs in,

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.795
or the device used by a user might also spring to mind.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.050
As long as the segments you thought of can be subdivided into

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.725
smaller groups that are likely to have different needs or use cases,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.135
you have identified a user segment of interest for the Food Fast app.

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:46.235
Note, if you're acting as a product manager for the Food Fast app,

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.580
you would need to make sure to ask your users to fill out profiles with

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.100
their demographic information to ensure you have

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.615
the information you want on your users when you go to segment.

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:59.480
Question 2 asks you to provide a reason that might

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.920
impact the way a user segment orders food via food delivery app.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.675
As a product manager,

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.020
you can access a great deal of information about users.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.740
Identifying segments of interests allows you to spend more time

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.960
analyzing segments that are most likely to have differences in performance and usage.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.560
One example of a segment you might see differences in behavior from is age,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.590
age would be a segment of interest,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980
because we know people in their teenage years are

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.695
more likely to still be in school than older adults.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.170
This might influence the hours during which delivery

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.890
occurs and the type of food being delivered,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.685
think late night study session versus healthy workbench.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.515
Of course, these are all just hypotheses,

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:43.910
but that we can think of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.510
these potential usage differences means we should probably dive into

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.240
the actual data to see if there are opportunities

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.425
to optimize the user experience for different age groups.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.300
Another example of a segment we should examine is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.620
a funnel conversion and feature usage for users on different device types.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.115
Because different devices provide different layouts and options,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:08.185
devices almost always something to consider when segmenting user Data.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:12.560
Mobile users might be on the go and want more quick order options,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.510
whereas desktop users with

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.294
their additional screen size might respond better to additional information and reviews,

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:21.885
plus some bugs are device specific,

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.590
so examining performance by device can indicate

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.320
potential technical issues or UX rough spots affecting only one device type.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.480
Question 3 asks us to break our identified segments

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.870
into smaller divisions that could be useful for comparison.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.680
Here are three examples of divisions you might use when looking at age,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.750
device, and location segments.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.545
For age, under 20s might be one useful age band,

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:51.080
which likely corresponds to a specific stage in a user's life, 21-25,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.945
and then the typical grouping of users into decades such as 26-35,

00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:58.475
36-45 and so on,

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:01.930
is one possible way to segment age into divisions.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.505
For device, useful segments are typically tablet versus smartphone versus desktop.

00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:10.550
Additional segmentation by operating system is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.705
also often applied when looking at device segments.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.630
Finally, for location, rural versus,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.800
suburban, versus urban are traditional divisions.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.755
In the case of a food delivery app,

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:24.800
which relies on restaurants near a user's location,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.210
we might want to consider

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.310
a slightly different approach that groups

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.620
users based on whether they have a small number,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.850
medium number, or large number of restaurants in a 20 mile delivery zone.
