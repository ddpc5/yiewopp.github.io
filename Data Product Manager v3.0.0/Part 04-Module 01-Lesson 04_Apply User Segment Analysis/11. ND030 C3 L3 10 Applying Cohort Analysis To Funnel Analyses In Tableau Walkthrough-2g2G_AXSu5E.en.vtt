00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.735
Let's walk through how to use Tableau to analyze user segment performance in a funnel.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:08.940
In Tableau you can see I've already completed step 1 of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.485
segment analysis of a funnel by creating the overall user funnel.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.170
For this funnel, a user begins by landing at

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.770
the homepage and completes the funnel when the purchase is made.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.200
Right now, the funnel shows the total number of users who completed each step.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
Now for step 2, I need to know which segments I want to analyze.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.450
For this example, let's look at the segment of devices.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.240
By adding the dimension of devices to the funnel analysis,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.310
we can see the device segment is divided into

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.989
groups of users on mobile and desktop computers.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.400
Step 3 and segment analysis of a funnel is to calculate drop-off between step,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.240
we can use a table calculation of percent change or

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.070
percent difference to calculate

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.510
the drop-off rate between each step for each segment group.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.130
If I go Quick Table Calculation and do Percent Difference and then adjust it,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.445
so that it's going down my table.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:09.830
Great, now that we've generated these figures,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.720
it is time for step 4.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.150
Look for under or over performance,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.510
Converting between steps on the funnel.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.185
Looking at the data,

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:21.110
we can see that mobile users have

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.840
almost a 10 percent lower drop-off rate between the search and payment pages.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.720
They also have about a five percent lower drop-off rate,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.990
between the payment and payment confirmation pages.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.795
These may indicate areas for desktop optimization.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:40.430
Based on these findings,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.830
we should talk to users and I'll review

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.860
the desktop design to determine what may be causing the higher drop-off rates.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.410
This will help us to find ways to improve the user experience,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.530
and possibly increase desktop segment purchases.
