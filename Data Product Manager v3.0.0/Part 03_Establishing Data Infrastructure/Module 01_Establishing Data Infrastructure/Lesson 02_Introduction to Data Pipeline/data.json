The document contains the questions relevant to each activity.\n\nResources are available in the navigation panel on the left side of the screen under search. You may need to click the 3 lines to show the menu if it's hidden.\n\nThis spreadsheet is saved in Excel format but can be opened in any spreadsheet application.\n\nAll video exercises were completed in Google Sheets/Docs. If you want to follow along using Google Sheets/Docs or if you don't have Microsoft Office, please follow the direction below:\n\nUpload the Exercises file into Google Drive\nClick on it and choose Open With\nSelect Google Sheets/Docs depending on the file\nIf the file opens in Google Drive's Compatibility Mode, indicated by an Excel X or Word X icon in the top right of the spreadsheet,\n\nClick on File in the Menu Bar\nClick Save as Google Sheets/Docs\nGoogle will convert the file and allow you to follow along using Google Sheets/Docs.\n\nIf you have other spreadsheet software or use MS Office, the Excel file should open in that software as well, but you will need to consult the documentation for that software to create the visualizations in this course for your spreadsheet software as the steps may be different from Google Sheets/Docs\n\n## Important Keep a Copy of your Exercise Responses in the Template Document\n\nIt is highly recommended that as you complete the open-ended exercises in this course, you should keep them in the provided template document to refer back to throughout the course. It will be extremely useful as you complete the Final Exercise in the course: Knapsack Data Strategy MVP in the Data Strategy section of this course. You can still copy and paste your responses into the text boxes on each page in the course for each exercise if you wish.",

Transforms or replicates data\n\nData Pipeline key takeaways:\n1. Data pipelines could be a third-party solution or built in-house.\n2. Data pipelines must be optimized for a specific use case.\n3. Data pipelines could be built-in cloud or on-prem. Data pipelines can be built using open-source or commercial technologies.  \n\n### Knapsack\nThroughout this course, we will be pretending to work as a data product manager for a fictional eCommerce business called Knapsack. Knapsack sells backpacks. Everyone needs a cool bag these days.\n\nOur fictional website is Knapsack.com, and we have an app (iOS & Android) with the name knapsack. We want to collect and use data. Data will be generated from the website and mobile app. We will be using this data for some business insights and maybe some machine learning applications as well.",

The Smart Knapsack has the following features:\n- Anti-theft device\n- Wifi signal booster\n- Solar panel to charge devices  \n- Retractable light\n- One button 911 dial with location tracking. \n\nAdd the new components of the Knapsack data pipeline around storage to create a more advanced picture of Knapsack's data pipeline.

Also remember that your solution might look different from the solution provided!\n\n### Apply in a New Context\nIn this exercise, you are going to try to take what you have learned and apply it in a new context.  \n\nYou are the product manager of Alex Headphones. These are new connected headphones that allow the user to connect to any device or use the headphones over a wireless network and can connect and use any voice assistant. They can provide the user with just in time updates to their daily schedule and connect to any music service. Setup and control happen via either a native iOS/Android App or via a web interface. Also, your company has chosen to use AWS and its products for its data pipeline. \n\n**If you are more familiar with other similar products, you can use those in place of AWS. However, the solution is given using AWS.\n\nYou are tasked with creating the outline of a data pipeline with all its components. Along with your imagination, use what you have learned in this lesson and create the model. Also, reflect on why these components are needed. You may also want to create your outline visually, as we have done with the exercises previously. You can use a drawing tool like draw.io or Google drawing or create a simple text outline to complete this activity. \n\nYour outline should include:"

The data is used for distributed storage, and to run compute over big data, it uses frameworks such as Hadoop and Apache Spark.\n\n**Data Storage**:  we already know for intermediate data storage we are using S3, along with that, we can use Amazon Redshift which is a data warehouse. \n\n**Data Destinations**:  Amazon Sagemaker a cloud machine-learning platform and Amazon Quicksight a business intelligence service",

              "text": "## Glossary of Key Terms\n- **Data Pipeline**: A set of processes to move data from a source to destination, possibly transforming the data along the way.\n- **Use-case**: A specific situation in which a product or service could potentially be used.\n- **Real-Time Data Use-case**: Real-time data processing involves a continual input, process, and output of data. Data must be processed in a small time period (or near real-time).\n- **Batch Data Use-case**: Batch processing requires separate programs for input, process, and output. Generally done for periodic data needs such as monthly, weekly, etc. An example is payroll and billing systems.\n- **SaaS**: Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet.\n- **Slack**: Slack is a cloud-based proprietary instant messaging platform developed by Slack Technologies.\n- **Salesforce**: Salesforce is a customer relationship management solution.\n- **Stripe**: Stripe is online payment processing for internet businesses. It allows individuals and companies to make and receive payments over the Internet.\n- **QuickBooks**: QuickBooks is an accounting software geared mainly toward small and medium-sized businesses and offers on-premises accounting applications as well as cloud-based versions that accept business payments, manage and pay bills, and payroll functions.\n- **IoT**: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\n- **Schema**: A data schema is a structure for organizing and classifying data in a database. It defines both the data contents and relationships. \n- **Data Normalization**: Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database following a series of so-called normal forms to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. \n- **Entity Data**: Entity data terminology is used for data in a database. It might be organized in tables. It depicts the current state of your application/business - users, products, prices, etc.\n- **Event Data**: Event data is generated by actions that happen in an application. The scale at which event data is generated is much larger compared to entity data. For every one user using the app, there could be thousands of events. Server logs also generate event data. ",
