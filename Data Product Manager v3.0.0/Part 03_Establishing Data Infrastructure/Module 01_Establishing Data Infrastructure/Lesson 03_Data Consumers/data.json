It will be advantageous as you complete the Final Exercise in the course: Knapsack Data Strategy MVP in the Data Strategy section of this course. You can still copy and paste your responses into the text boxes on each page in the course for each exercise if you wish.\n\n\n## If you are using something other than Microsoft Office\nThis spreadsheet is saved in Excel format but can be opened in any spreadsheet application.\n\nAll video exercises were completed in Google Sheets/Docs, and if you want to follow along using Google Sheets/Docs or if you don't have Microsoft Office, please follow the direction below:\n\n- Upload the Exercises file into Google Drive\n- Click on it and choose Open With\n- Select Google Sheets/Docs depending on the file\n\nIf the file opens in Google Drive's Compatibility Mode, indicated by an Excel X or Word X icon in the top right of the spreadsheet,\n- Click on File in the Menu Bar\n- Click Save as Google Sheets/Docs\n- Google will convert the file and allow you to follow along using Google Sheets/Docs.\n\nIf you have other spreadsheet software or use MS Office, the Excel file should open in that software as well, but you will need to consult the documentation for that software to complete the activities in this course for your spreadsheet software as the steps may be different from Google Sheets/Docs.",

A data consumer would be a person, an organization, or a system that uses data for a specific purpose. A data consumer can also be a data producer. How is that possible? \n\nTo further understand our data stakeholders, we will have to dive deep into:  \n- How does a data consumer want to use data? Is it for reporting, creating a visualization, for reconciliation, or building ML models?\n- What tools are being used by users? Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, or Google Data Studio.\n- Are there any standards within a particular community of users? Legal might want data differently than accounting or finance.\n\nHere we also need to understand that sometimes we might have to provide the same data in multiple formats to satisfy the needs of different consumer groups.\n",

One row is dedicated to recording one type of each entity.\n\nThe concepts discussed here are fundamental to the understanding of relational databases. Relational databases have data stored in tables that are related to each other through keys. \n\nThis type of entity data helps capture our application's current state, such as our customers' information or what the product range is.\n\nThe drawback of the entity data model is that the joins might get complicated and introduce latency. \n\nThe advantages are the removal of data duplication and a simple, easy to understand basic structure.

Once we have relationships established, we can run complex queries to join data from different tables. \n\nThe concepts discussed here are fundamental to the understanding of relational databases. \n- Relational databases have data in tables\n- Tables are linked through keys\n- Data in these tables is normalized. \n\nIn our example, if we want to create a buying pattern for Jon, we can join the order table and product table to see Jon prefers a red color product and is a frequent buyer.  This information is essential for marketing to advertise to Jon the products that fall in the red color palette. This information is also vital for inventory management teams as they can predict the demand for red-colored products and have inventory accordingly.  \n\nWe have a minimal data set here. Generally, these insights are derived from tables that could have millions of rows.\n\n**Normalization** refers to eliminating redundancy. Each table should have data around a specific topic. This eliminates modification complexities and saves on storage.\n\n",

Product Management is not conducted in a vacuum, and you will be working directly with the types of teams we are using in our example. Much of product management is subjective, but this course and it's exercises are meant to help you anticipate the needs of your stakeholders and help identify who you need to talk to. \n\n### Entity Modeling:\n**Primary Keys**:\n- **Customer ID** is the primary key for customer table and customer demographics table\n- **Product ID** is the primary key for Product table\n- **Order ID** is the primary key for order Details table\n\n**Foreign Keys**:\n- **Customer ID** and **Product ID** for the Order Details Table",

Some common tools, SAP, Microsoft Power BI.\n- **Visualization** - Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Some common tools are Tableau, QlikView.\n- **Reporting** - A report is a document that presents information in an organized format for a specific audience and purpose. Although summaries of reports may be delivered orally, complete reports are almost always in the form of written documents. Business reporting or enterprise reporting refers to both \"the public reporting of operating and financial data by a business enterprise, and \"the regular provision of information to decision-makers within an organization to support them in their work. Some common tools are Sap Crystal Reports, Zoho.\n- **Big Data** - Big Data is described with the “three Vs”, the volume of big-data is measured in terabytes or petabytes, the velocity at which data is generated is high and lastly it has a wide variety of sources such as text files, images, video, audio files, presentations, spreadsheets, email messages, and databases.\n- **AI and ML** - Artificial Intelligence means “making machines intelligent,” so they can make some decisions on their own according to the situations without the need for any human interference. And Machine Learning is “the way to make those machines intelligent.” Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on a narrow range of activities.\n- **Entity** - Entity is a unique object such as customer, product, order etc.\n- **Entity Attributes** - Attributes are the properties that describe it, for a customer entity attributes could be Name, address, email, phone. \n- **Entity Data** - Entity data is the data that is stored in a table. For every entity there is a separate table, and every table has columns that are attributes describing these entities. One row is dedicated to recording one type of entity. \n- **Relational Modeling** -  Relational modeling is forming relationships between data tables.\n- **Normalization** - Normalization refers to eliminating redundancy. Each table should have data around a specific topic. This eliminates modification complexities and saves on storage.\n- **Key** - A key is an index to a record in a table.\n- **Primary Key** - Primary keys are unique identifiers for a record in a table. There is only one primary key in a table. Primary key column cannot be blank or null. \n- **Foreign Key** - A foreign key is a set of one or more columns that refer to a primary key in another table. A table can have one or more foreign keys. Foreign keys can contain duplicates and can have null values.\n\n\n",
