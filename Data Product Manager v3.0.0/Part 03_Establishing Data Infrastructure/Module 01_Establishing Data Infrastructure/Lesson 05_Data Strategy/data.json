In this type of processing pipeline, data is first extracted from various sources, after that transformed and loaded to a Database or Data Warehouse, from where it is pulled for analysis.\n\n- **[Data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing)** is, generally, the collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information.\n- **[Data extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction)** is the act or process of retrieving data out of data sources for further data processing or data storage. \n- **In the [data transformation stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)**, a series of rules or functions are applied to the extracted data in order to prepare it for loading into the end target.\n- **The load phase**: loads the data into the end target, which can be any data store including a simple delimited flat file or a data warehouse.

This might make it really hard to scale an ETL pipeline. \n- Transforming all the data before loading might be an overkill. \n    - *Example*: you might not need to process all the event data generated on the website at once. \n\n### Challenges continued: \n**Different Data Types**\n\nEntity data needs to be treated very differently than event data. Similarly, structured data, semi-structured data, or unstructured data. All have specific needs. ETLs work best with **entity** and **structured data**. Implementing ETL for other data types can be challenging. \n\n**Different Data Sources**\n\nData sources are varied and spread across. We have data on-prem and in the cloud. We have constant streams of data, and we have batches of data. With ETL pipelines it might be difficult and slow to bring all this data together.\n\n",

It is still evolving; it is hard to find resources with expertise in this domain. \n- **Corner Cases**: ETL requires stringent standards to avoid security risk and removing, masking or encrypting data might be harder",

An example being an Oracle source and Oracle target. There would be no reason to do unnecessary processing before loading data from the source Oracle database to the destination Oracle database?\n\n**Huge Data Volumes**\n\n\nWhen data volumes are huge, you do not want to process anything and everything under the Sun. This is the reality for most enterprises. Data volumes are huge; hence ELTs might work better as they won’t become bottlenecks. \n\n**Data is unstructured or mixed structure**\n\n\nELTs are better when you have a mix of data types. For a use case of customer sentiment analysis where you might have data such as user reviews, emails, customer care chat scripts, ELT will work better. \n\n",

              "text": "\nA **[database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)** is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.\n\nA **[data warehouse](https://aws.amazon.com/data-warehouse/)** is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make better-informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational Databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. \n\nTo summarize, Data Warehouses are required to store large quantities of historical data and provide fast, complex queries across all the data, mostly using OLAPS. Databases focus on storing current transactional data to enable fast access to specific data for business processes. This is how OLTPs work.\n\n### Types of Database\nDatabases can be categorized into two major classes SQL Databases and No SQL Databases. \n\n**SQL Databases** are the classic category of Databases they store data in tables, data is relational in nature and can be queried using SQL. **Schemas** need to be defined. A **Schema** is nothing but an organization of data as a blueprint of how the  Databases is constructed. \n\nCommon SQL Databases are [MS SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) \n\n**No SQL Databases**\n- **Document oriented**\n\nDocument oriented Databases do not have a fixed schema. Data is stored in JSON documents, each document can have different fields common examples are [Mongo DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), [CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/) or [Documentdb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DocumentDB)\n- **Columnar Databases**\n\nIn columnar Databases data is stored in columns instead of how it is stored in rows in relational DBs. Column based queries can run fast on these DBs. It is much easier in columnar Databases to add columns than their counterpart relational DBs. One common example of the most popular columnar  Databases is [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra).\n\n- **Key-Value Databases**\n\nIn key-value Databases, values are stored with unique keys. These Databases are much simpler and capable of reads and write. Examples of key-value Databases are [Redis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis) and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB).\n\n- **Graph Databases**\n\nIn graph Databases, data is stored as a network. These Databases focus on connections between data points and are used for the analysis of relationships between data points. Examples of graph Databases are [Infinite Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniteGraph) and [Neo4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniteGraph). ",

ELTs make it easy to use Data lakes for such experimental analysis. \n\n-  Cybersecurity \n\nCybersecurity data collection and analysis is a great use case of data lakes. Any enterprise devices such as laptops, servers, cloud computing devices, and virtual systems all are vulnerable. Add connected devices to this mix. It becomes a big data problem that can be solved using Data lakes. \n\n- Customer Data Platform\n\nData Lakes can be used to build customer data platforms to provide rich customer insights. Data for such platforms can come from various sources such as \n- customer profile Databases\n- web and mobile events\n- brick and mortar systems\n- loyalty systems\n- service center data \n\nThis data can be of any type of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Data Lakes work best for such use cases. ",

When you have Historical data that has been structured to fit a relational database schema, use Data Warehouses.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nWhen you need cost-effective big data storage, use a Data Lake. When you need to store data to run analytics for business decisions, use Data Warehouses.\n\n#### Users\n\nData Lake users are often data scientists and engineers, whereas Data Wharehouse users are data analysts and business analysts.\n\n#### Workload\nData Lakes are suitable for storing massive data and big data analytics, like deep learning and real-time analytics. Data Warehouses are ideal for a smaller set of data compared to DL and are used for typical read-only queries that aggregate or summarize data.\n\n#### Size\nData Lakes store all data that might be used and can take up to petabytes! Data Warehouses store only data relevant to the analysis.\n\n#### Neither/Both?\nSometimes neither or both are better, while there are specific scenarios for each one, most enterprises adopt a hybrid approach. A business may catch all their data in a data lake and build ETL on top of it to feed DWH. For a small business, you might not need either.",

For example, HR solutions. \n- If the problems have already been solved and there are market leaders available with solutions. For example, buying cloud storage on AWS or on Azure would be better than building it. \n- Buying some of the tech solutions will help you scale more quickly and reduce your speed to market.\n\n### Additional Resources\n[Uber Under Invested in Technology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uber-we-under-invested-in-technology)\n",

Sometimes you might want to own some parts, and you might want to outsource a few. Data needs a lot of massaging before it can be consumed. You might want to own some critical and strategic pieces. The long term of having inhouse expertise for such data infrastructure pieces could provide a competitive advantage. It might also help in retaining high-quality talent. Outsourcing pieces that do not offer you a competitive advantage might help you scale and focus on core business functions.   \n\nInsourcing is doing a project with internal resources, while outsourcing is getting it done outside your company.\n\n## Insource or Inhouse\nYou should insource when \n- Intellectual Property or IP must remain in-house\n- When an understanding of culture and product is required\n- When the work that needs to be done aligns with core business activities, and when the project deals with sensitive enterprise information such as security data.\n\n## Outsource \nYou should outsource when \n- A variety of skills are needed to complete the project. Outsourcing gives you access to a larger talent pool. \n- You should consider outsourcing when the work does not fall into the category of your core business function. \n- You should also consider outsourcing when you need to scale since it can be cost-effective.\n\n\n\n",

There are many regulations and standards in today's world that have to be incorporated into a Data Strategy. If these are not addressed, your company will be open to huge fines for violations. Below you will find most of the critical items to consider, but remember that one of our stakeholders, Security and/or Legal, will help address compliance regulation.\n\n### PII\n**[PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)**: \"Personal data, also known as personal information or personally identifiable information (PII)is any information relating to an identifiable person.\" \n\n**Keep the following in mind when Handling PII:**\n- Know local laws and definitions\n- Identify where all PII is\n    - **Data at rest**: Data that is stored in a storage device and is not actively used \n    - **Data in motion**: Data that is being used \n- Establish data retention policies\n- Governance and controls\n\n### PCI DSS\n**[PCI DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard)**: \"The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes.\"\n\nIf you have PCI data, you need to follow stringent compliance guidelines, and there will be regular audits. If the procedures are not followed, there will be fines and legal ramifications.\n\n**Core Control Objectives of PCI Data**\n1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems\n2. Protect Cardholder Data\n3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program\n4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures\n5. Regularly Monitor and Test Networks\n6. Maintain an Information Security Policy\n\n### HIPAA\n**[HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)**- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n**Protected Health Information (PHI)- medical record numbers, device identifiers and serial numbers. Any company or individual that comes into contact with PHI must enact and enforce appropriate policies, procedures, and safeguards to protect data.\n\n**Violations lead to**:\n- Termination from Job\n- Sanctions from professional boards\n- Criminal charges including fines and imprisonment\n\n\nMore information: [HIPAA for Dummies](https://www.hipaaguide.net/hipaa-for-dummies)\n\n### GDPR\n**[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)**: General Data Protection Regulation\n- European Union and European Economic Area\n- More control to citizens over their data\n- Fines up to 20 Million Euros or 4% of global turnover\n- Know what you have and why you have it?\n- Where is the data, who uses it, and how is it used?\n- Encryption is key\n- Data Governance is highly recommended\n\n### CCPA\n**[CCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act)**: California Consumer Privacy Act\n\nThis act gives Californians the right \n- To know what personal information is being collected about them?\n- To Know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom?\n- To say no to the sale of personal information.\n- To access their personal data.\n- To have equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.
