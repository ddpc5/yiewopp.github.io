00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
Let us revisit Knapsack.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.685
This is this how Knapsack data pipeline looks like.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:11.955
As you can see, I have added storage devices that were not shown in earlier model.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.960
This is because no pipeline is ever complete without a data storage.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.530
We will discuss in details about data storage in a later lesson.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.115
Now, we'll look at the various components of this pipeline.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.720
To recap, our data origin points would be website,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.405
app, SaaS solutions, and our connected backpacks.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:35.940
We have a processing data pipeline,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
it could be ETL or ELT.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.215
We will discuss this also in details later.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:49.465
Ingestion, transformation, and delivery of data will happen here. Data storage.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.810
We have two types of data storage,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.100
traditional database that stores structured or process data

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.840
for our business professionals,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.870
data lakes that store structured,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.015
semi-structured and unstructured data for our data scientists.

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:05.645
Last but not the least,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:07.730
we have our data destination.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.170
The application that data scientists team is using for ML modeling and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.050
the business intelligence stuff where that business team is using for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.580
business insights are our data destinations.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.960
The new group that we have introduced in last few concepts is our SaaS solution.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.705
We will feed data to these solutions for accounting and for creating marketing campaigns.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.780
These are also our data destinations.
