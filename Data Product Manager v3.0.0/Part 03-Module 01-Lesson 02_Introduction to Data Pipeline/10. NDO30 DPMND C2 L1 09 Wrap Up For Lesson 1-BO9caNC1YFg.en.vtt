Wow. We really have made it to the end of Lesson 1 in no time.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.885
You are doing fantastic.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:10.320
To recap, in this lesson we learned that,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.860
data pipelines transport data can have multiple inputs

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.805
and multiple outputs and can transform or replicate data.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.015
SaaS and IoT are changing data landscape.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.440
Flexible data pipelines bring around data completeness and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.165
data validation can help us address some of our classic data problems.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.840
When it comes to data pipeline competence, we need to think,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.030
from where data is originating,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.900
where data is delivered,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.390
where data is processed and where data should be stored.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.090
Now, that you have learned to create and model

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.540
some basic data pipelines along with its component,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.565
it's time to dig a little deeper into various aspects of data infrastructure.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:56.430
I see you in the next lesson on data consumers.
