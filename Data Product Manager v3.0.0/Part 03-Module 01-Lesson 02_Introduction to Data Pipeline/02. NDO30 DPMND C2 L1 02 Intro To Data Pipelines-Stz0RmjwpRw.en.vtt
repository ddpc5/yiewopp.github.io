00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
We'll start with exploring what exactly it means when we say data pipeline.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.710
A data pipeline is a set of processes to move data from a source to destination,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.010
possibly transforming the data along the way.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.575
We'll understand this with an example.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.750
We have an e-commerce business.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.250
We sell backpacks.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.965
Our site is knapsack.com,

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:24.435
and we have an app,

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:27.930
iOS and Android with the name knapsack.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.375
We want to collect and use data.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.080
Data will be generated from the website and mobile app.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.390
We will be using this data for

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.145
some business insights and maybe for some machine learning applications.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.990
What will the data pipeline do here?

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.680
It will collect data from data producers,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.845
process it depending on business requirements

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.639
and deliver it to the stakeholders for making business decisions.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.280
This graphic represents a very basic view of

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.070
what our data pipeline for knapsack might look like.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.010
There are data producers,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.810
a pipeline to do something with the data and the consumers of that data.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.160
It's important to be able to visualize

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.795
a data pipeline and is a skill a data product manager should possess.

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:17.720
Before you create your own visualizations,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.040
you first need to be able to identify the parts of a data pipeline.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.525
A data pipeline is something that takes data from one place to another,

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.209
has one or more data inputs,

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.964
has one or more data outputs,

00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:36.420
transforms or replicates data.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.330
A few more things to note about data pipelines are,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.265
data pipeline could be a third party solutions such as Alooma,

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:53.015
segment or stitch data or it could be built in house carefully selecting each part.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.170
An enterprise might have multiple data pipelines,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.590
each optimized for a specific set of use cases.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.600
A data pipeline could be,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.240
optimized for real-time use cases,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.980
or for batch data use cases.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.230
Data pipelines could be building

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.285
cloud where in every piece of technology is hosted on cloud.

00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:20.800
This may save on infrastructure and on expert resources needed.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.775
Data pipelines could also be built using open source solution.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:30.115
That gives businesses a huge opportunity to customize,

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:34.475
also it saves cost of buying commercial data products.

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:38.375
If we already have in house expertise to make it work,

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.735
then it's better to have built in house,

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:45.300
and this brings us to the end of this concept.
