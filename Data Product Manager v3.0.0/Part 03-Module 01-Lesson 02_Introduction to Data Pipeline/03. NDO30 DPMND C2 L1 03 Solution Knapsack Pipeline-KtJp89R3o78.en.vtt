00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
A basic data pipeline for Knapsack will collect data from data producer,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.770
in this case, website and mobile app,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.115
process it, and deliver it to data destination.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.625
In this case, machine learning app and BI too.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.500
Here, data pipeline is taking data from one place to another,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.614
has two data inputs,

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:23.595
has two data outputs,

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:26.199
and a processing pipeline.
