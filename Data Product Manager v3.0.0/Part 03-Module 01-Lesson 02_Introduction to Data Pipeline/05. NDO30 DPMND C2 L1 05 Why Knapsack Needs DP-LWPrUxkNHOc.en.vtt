00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
This is how our data pipeline look before.

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:07.454
With Simply Accounting, Just Sale and Smart Knapsack,

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:09.900
we have added few more elements.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.970
Simply Accounting and Just Sale are our SaaS solutions.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.480
These will also generate data and that will be

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
used as input for analysis, reporting, and recording.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.440
Our newly launched Smart Knapsack is a connected backpack.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.695
It has sensor that are continuously generating and sending data.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.590
We need this data to monitor performance of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.595
our Beta product to understand how product is doing.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:43.490
Another important factor here is both our SaaS solutions are not only data producers,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.120
but will also be data consumers.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.120
This is because we will provide our transactional data to

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.870
Simply Accounting to make automated accounting entries.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.990
We will also provide customer data to Just Sales for targeted marketing campaigns.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.280
Why do we need data pipeline for Knapsack?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.990
Introducing Simply Accounting and Just Sales

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.230
has brought in the possibility of data getting siloed.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.885
Hence, we need data pipeline to centralize and normalize data.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:17.650
As Smart Knapsack is generating continuous stream of data.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.120
So we need highly optimized and automated data pipelines.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.230
The more things are getting added,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.080
the more we can see our data is growing.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.810
So we need scalable data pipelines.
