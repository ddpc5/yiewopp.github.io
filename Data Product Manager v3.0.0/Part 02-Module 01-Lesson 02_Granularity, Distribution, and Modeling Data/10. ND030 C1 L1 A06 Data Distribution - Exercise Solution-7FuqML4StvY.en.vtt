00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.510
In Tableau, your measure is the average of review score,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.905
and you use region as a dimension to compare and contrast distributions.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:17.860
Visualize your review measure as a row and ensure that you're selected on a text table.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.720
Cast your measure to a standard deviation.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.900
Here's the standard deviation across all products in all countries.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.170
But we would want to filter by product ID of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.340
three to ensure our analysis is limited to smartwatches only.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.800
Finally, take the country dimension as

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.445
a column to split out standard deviation by country.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.900
You can see that Canada, Japan,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.915
and Brazil have the highest standard deviation,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:55.460
indicating that they have the widest spread of positive and negative reviews,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.560
warranting additional deep dive.
