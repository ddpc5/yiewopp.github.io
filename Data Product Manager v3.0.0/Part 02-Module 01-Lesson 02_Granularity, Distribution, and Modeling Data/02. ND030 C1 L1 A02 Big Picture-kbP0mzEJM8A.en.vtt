00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.094
Imagine you're a product manager at Spotify

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.960
focused on improving the listening experience.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.165
You have access to a dataset that contains all Spotify's playback streams.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.275
You are working with the Spotify premium growth team to understand

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:21.045
how much stream quality affects both skipped and song completion rates.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.695
As you start to look at the data,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.555
you notice a couple of phenomena.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:27.450
The average time in a song when listeners

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.810
skip a song tends to be way higher than you expected,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.465
sitting at 46 seconds into the song.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.010
On the flip side, the song completion percentage rate or

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.075
meaning the percentage of songs that were listened from end-to-end,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.090
tend to be way higher than you expected sitting

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.305
at 92 percent of all songs that were listened to.

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.435
Is this real life or just a fantasy?

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:55.220
Before analysis, product managers should understand the granularity,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.564
distribution and the nuances behind their datasets.

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:01.280
Upon further investigation, you realize that

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.625
this table is built specifically for music label reporting,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:09.710
it considers play events as songs that have been played for 30 seconds or more.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.510
You may want to consider looking at

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.500
an upstream table that does not have this filter pre applied,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.870
so that you could include songs that have been

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.035
played for a less than 30 seconds in your analysis.

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.610
Please do note that this scenario is hypothetical in contractual definitions on

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.190
what constitutes a song play may differ between label and distribution platform.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.315
You also noticed that there is a Boolean field in the table called Fraud_stream,

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:38.210
which you find out is powered by an algorithm in

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.335
the back end that predicts whether or not the stream is fraudulent.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.080
As an example, there may be artists that are

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.710
allowing playback bots to boost up their stream counts.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.720
You'll most likely want to filter out

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.035
these potentially fraudulent streams from your analysis.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:58.040
You need to be quick at identifying and understanding the granularity,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.860
distribution and how the data is modeled so that

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.460
your analyses are not skewed, biased, or misdirectional.
