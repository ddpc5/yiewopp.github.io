00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.470
In this lesson, we'll learn how to determine

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
the granularity of data and what data is being measured in a data set.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.010
Techniques on how to find out the average, median,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
and standard deviation of your data in a data set.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.010
Finally, common practices around how data is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.235
stored and accessed through a fact dimensional model.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.080
I'll see you soon for the next lesson,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.660
we're all focus on extracting meaningful trends,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.480
enriching data, and visualizing insights.
