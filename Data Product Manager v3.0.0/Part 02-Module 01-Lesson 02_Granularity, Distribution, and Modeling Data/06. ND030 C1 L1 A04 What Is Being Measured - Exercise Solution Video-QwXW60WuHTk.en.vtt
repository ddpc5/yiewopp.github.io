00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.450
Running a simple count of the total number of rows on the table,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.800
we see that it contains 506 active subscriptions.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.180
We want to see if each subscriber is tied to exactly one subscription.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.955
Hence, we run another query counting the number of distinct subscribers,

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:24.215
only to find out that there are some subscribers that are double counted in the table,

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:26.960
leading to our suspicion that there are cases where

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.940
some subscribers are subscribed to more than one type of subscription at the same time.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.725
So here we confirm our primary key is not subscriber ID.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:41.464
We run another query that counts the distinct number of subscriber IDs

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:46.285
concatenated with subscription ID to confirm that our suspicions are correct.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:49.910
The primary key for this table is not subscriber itself,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.780
but rather both subscriber ID and subscription ID.
