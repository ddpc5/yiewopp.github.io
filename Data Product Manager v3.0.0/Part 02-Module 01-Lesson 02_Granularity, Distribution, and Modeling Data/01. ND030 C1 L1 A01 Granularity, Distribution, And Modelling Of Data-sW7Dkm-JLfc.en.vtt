00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.655
In this lesson, we'll be focused on understanding the granularity,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.730
the distribution, and the modeling of data.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.720
Granularity is defined by what exactly is being measured

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.575
in a dataset or basically what each row represents.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.135
A table could be measuring

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:22.740
individual sales or a table could be measuring individual orders,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.575
which could constitute of multiple sales.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.490
Distribution is defined by how spread apart is the data,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.680
where's the center of the data in terms of

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.190
both numerical value and number of data points.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.030
Modeling is defined by how data could be spread across

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.080
multiple tables and how data can be aggregated or pre-counted for query efficiency.
