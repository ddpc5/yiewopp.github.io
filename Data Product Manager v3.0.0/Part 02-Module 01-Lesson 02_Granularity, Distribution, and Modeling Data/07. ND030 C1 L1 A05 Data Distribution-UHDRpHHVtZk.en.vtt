00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.935
Distribution is defined by how spread apart the data is.

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.555
Where is the center of the data in terms of numerical value and its data points?

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.705
A foundational way to understand data distribution

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.675
is to quickly see and interpret how range,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:20.095
median, standard deviation, and the outliers of a dataset.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:25.070
Some example applications in product management to understand distribution are,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.625
understanding the inherent elasticity of price for a product,

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.620
so that you could predict shifts in adoption and retention

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.245
if you experiment on different price increases and decreases.

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:40.385
Identifying the outliers of users that may pose as edge cases,

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.440
either as underserved or power

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.865
users that are using your product in a slightly different way.

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:48.275
Understanding how the data is spread out,

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:52.160
categorizing different peaks into different user segments so that you could

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.845
create different features and products for each segment that may have different needs.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.900
The average, also known as the mean,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.000
is the value of the central point in a dataset based on the strength of other values.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.010
The basic formula is simple.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.580
If you have a set of numbers, add them up,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.010
and then divide by the total number of values in your set to get the average.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.950
To calculate averages in Tableau,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.955
you'll want to double-click on one of your measures in the left sidebar.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:26.090
Click on the drop-down icon in the Measure of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.355
the row section and change the Measure from sum to average.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:36.990
Ensure your visualization type that you have selected is a text table.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.690
To analyze average by different dimensions or slices,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.350
double-click on one or more of your dimensions in the left sidebar.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.700
The middle data point in your distribution in terms

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.505
of the total number of data points is the median.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:57.565
In this example scenario,

00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:02.350
you have a data set that contains real estate transaction prices in Dallas, Texas.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.505
You have seven data points.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:10.000
The median is $265,000 because it's the middle data point in

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.490
your distribution in terms of the total number of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.845
data points ranked from lowest to highest.

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:17.815
If we calculate average,

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:19.810
it will be a little higher than the median in

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.975
this scenario due to the outliers skewing the dataset.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:27.250
Knowing the median is great when you want to gain a frame of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.320
reference on what the central point is of a dataset,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.940
without having it being skewed by heavy outliers.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.615
To calculate the median in Tableau,

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.755
it'll be an identical process to calculating average.

00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:43.760
You'll want to double-click on one of your measures in the left sidebar.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.940
Click on the drop-down icon in the measure on

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.695
the rows section and change the measure from sum to median.

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:56.360
Again, ensure that you select it on text table.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.370
The standard deviation is a measure of how dispersed a dataset is,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.250
or the values clustered together near the average,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.355
or they're spread out across a fairly wide range,

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:08.960
far away from the average.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.000
Are they spread out more on the left side of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.525
the average or the right side of the average?

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:17.900
One standard deviation from the mean is the distance from the mean that

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.815
represents 68 percent of all values in the dataset falling within the range.

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.899
Two standard deviations from the mean represents

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.740
95 percent of all values within that range.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.020
Let's say I have 100 values and the mean is 35.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.865
Say 68 of the values fall within 25 and 45 of the mean.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:45.770
That means that one standard deviation from the mean is 10.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.885
This 25 and 45 are both within a distance of 10 from the mean.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:54.540
Too simple to calculate the standard deviation in Tableau.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.465
Follow the same process as what you did to calculate the average and the median,

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:03.420
but this time select standard deviation for a measure.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.180
This represents how far the lower and upper bounds are from the mean

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.690
that represents 68 percent of values found in the dataset.
