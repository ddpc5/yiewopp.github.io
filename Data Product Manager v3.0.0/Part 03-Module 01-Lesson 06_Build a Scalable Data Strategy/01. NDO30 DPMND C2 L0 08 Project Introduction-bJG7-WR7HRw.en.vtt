00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Project introduction.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.340
Theme of our project is Scalable Data Strategy.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.965
As any real life product manager,

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:09.900
you will be required to;

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.585
identify requirements of data consumers.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.235
You will do some data modeling and answer business questions.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.740
You will do some data processing.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.425
You will flex your strategy muscle to make infrastructure technology decisions.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:30.135
In the end, you will write a data strategy MVP proposal.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.900
One important note, your thoughts may look different than

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.050
mine while doing project or classroom exercises and that is all right.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.310
Project management is not conducted in a vacuum and you will be

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.155
working directly with the types of teams we are using in our examples.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.305
Much of project management is subjective,

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:57.750
but this course and its exercises are meant to help you anticipate the possibilities.
