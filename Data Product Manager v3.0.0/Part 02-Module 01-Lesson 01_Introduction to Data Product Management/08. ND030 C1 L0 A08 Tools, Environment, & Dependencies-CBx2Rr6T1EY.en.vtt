00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.940
You will need access to Tableau Public to analyze and visualize data.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.830
We've placed a link for you below to download.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.330
You'll also need basic knowledge of structured query language,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.520
or more commonly known as SQL.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.340
You can learn everything you need to know and more through

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.025
Udacity SQL for data analysis course, also a link below.

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:26.710
Throughout this course, you'll have direct access to Udacity's SQL workspace,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.855
which uses PostgreSQL under the hood.

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:33.630
PostgreSQL is nearly identical to the SQLite,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.854
Redshift, Presto, Hive, or MySQL syntax.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.730
But you may need a reference to it's

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.060
documentation if you want to do some really fancy analysis.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.320
Again, link below.
