00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.960
These are research or we call it, say, the feedback,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.240
is imperative, but it only tells half the story.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.650
You're constricted by the sample size of how many users you can

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.020
physically interview or gather qualitative feedback from.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.780
A user may describe their pain with existing product but you need to leverage

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.685
data to understand how prevalent that pain actually is throughout the user base at large.

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:28.930
Depending on the size and nature of the company,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.130
product managers may have access to data scientists to help them out with their analyses.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.110
If you don't, you have to do that analyses yourself.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.510
If you do, data science resources are oftentimes limited,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.275
and you have to be strategic on what you want data scientists to focus on.

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:52.640
You should take a self service approach to product analytics so that your data scientists

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.370
have more focus on deep statistical analyses in machine learning algorithm development.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.565
Here's an example scenario of what you will miss if you do not analyze the data.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:08.480
Say, you are PM for a personal finance app where users can aggregate

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.670
their ongoing expenses and income

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
into an intuitive dashboard for monitoring their budget.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.395
Users sometimes tend to not be too vocal about their inefficiencies,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.335
rather just accepting them for what they are.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:25.370
Let's say you notice your users manually inputting in data rather

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.470
than hooking up an integration with one of your existing banking partners.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.540
You parse through the strings of what the titles are for

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.635
these data inputs and you notice that the top value is Robin Hood.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.490
Upon further investigation, you realize that Robin Hood is not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.690
a current integration partner and you'll prioritize this to the top of your road map.
