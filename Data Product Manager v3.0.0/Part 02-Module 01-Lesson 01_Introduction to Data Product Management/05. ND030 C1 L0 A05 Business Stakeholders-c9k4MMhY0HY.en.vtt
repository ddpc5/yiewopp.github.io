00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.780
Let's take a look at the key stakeholders you'll be

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.240
working with as a data product manager.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.460
You'll be working extremely close with

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.690
data science to help you understand the nuances in the data,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.985
in addition to running any deep statistical analyses.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.385
Product marketing is another stakeholder.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.745
Product managers work with them to help determine pricing,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.950
strategize on market positioning,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.165
assess market viability, estimate the total addressable market,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.040
creating a role as strategy,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.604
and producing communications collateral.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:34.275
You'll be working closely with user research,

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:37.725
to recruit and interview users from different segments,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.715
before and after a launch.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:42.140
Data engineering is a close partner,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.405
where they are usually the team that collects,

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:47.960
transforms and stores batch and/or streaming

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.354
data into the desired output and location for a future analyses.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.370
Client engineering like web, Android,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.230
or iOS, built intuitive interfaces for end-user consumption.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.400
Always be sure to loop in legal, privacy,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.150
and compliance teams to determine data processing regulation requirements.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.880
Indoor ensure that the data products that you're

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.470
building are compliant with consumer protection laws.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.830
Finance and business operations are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.185
two closely ally teams that will help you measure unit economics,

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:25.090
business growth, and financial health metrics like revenue,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.880
churn, retention, gross margins,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.455
and new user acquisition rates.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:33.560
You'll need to work with sales and customer success,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.630
especially if you have a B2B product,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.725
to evangelize the limitations and capabilities of the current product.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:43.820
In addition to providing them with insights on the future roadmap,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.410
they'll also provide you feedback on the reasons or lack of features on why

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.050
potential customers may not end up signing deals or going to other competitors.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.300
If you have a global product,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.520
it will most likely need to be localized,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.240
or have text dynamically translated into

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.885
the various languages you support for international adoption and accessibility.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.600
Quality assurance engineering's goal is to break

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.435
your product or expose bugs in your product before your external users do.

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:17.875
They may end up finding a lot more issues than your team can physically work on.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.150
You will need to leverage analytics to make

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.880
a determination on which issues to tackle first,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.820
based on existing feature usage.
