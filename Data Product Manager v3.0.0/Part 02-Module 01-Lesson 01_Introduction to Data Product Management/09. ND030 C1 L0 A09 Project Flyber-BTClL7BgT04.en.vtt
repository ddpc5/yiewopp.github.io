00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.605
Finally, for your capstone project,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.530
you're the product manager for our transportation company, Flyber.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.450
Your goal is to analyze market and user research data to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
help you and your team make the following decisions on the OKRs,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.050
the features, and the launch details of Flybers, flying car MVP.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
You'll be uncovering insights and making decisions on the product

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.035
like where in New York City should we place flying taxi pickup locations?

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.975
Should we keep the service running 24 hours a day, seven days a week?

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:38.660
What features should we include in the initial product to measure

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.330
the viability and stickiness of the service without going all in right away?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.615
Finally, we'll be creating a proposal to pitch our case to stakeholders,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:51.050
are all across the board to get buy-in for the execution and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.400
development of Flyber's MVP or minimum viable product.
