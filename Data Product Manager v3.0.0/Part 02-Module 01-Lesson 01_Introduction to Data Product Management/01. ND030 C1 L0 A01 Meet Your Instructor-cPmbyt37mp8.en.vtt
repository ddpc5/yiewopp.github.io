Hey there. My name is JJ and I'm excited to teach you about data product management.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.740
Started my career as

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
a Geospacial Data Analyst at Apple in Cupertino for their Maps division.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.090
I later transitioned over to Beats Music in San Francisco as a Data Engineer focused on

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.190
building analytics and reporting

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.285
infrastructure for our music label partners like Universal,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.370
Sony, and Warner Music.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.265
Beats Music was later then acquired by Apple.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.870
So I came back full circle,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.555
this time as a Product Manager at Apple,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:36.030
where I built our data products to empower

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.880
app developers to grow their business with Apple.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.620
After five years at Apple,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.405
I created a smaller, scrappier environment.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:47.000
So I moved over to data platform product management in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.870
various startups in the fields ranging from mobile photography to consumer healthcare.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.090
I love leveraging data to make decisions,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.610
using data to help external users make their decisions and building our data platforms,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.135
so that data analysts and scientists have accessible,

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:09.360
clean data ready at their fingertips for some insight extraction.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.015
I wouldn't have gotten to where I am today without online course throughout the years,

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.400
so I'm really excited to give back to the community.
