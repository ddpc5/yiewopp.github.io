00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Hey there. My name is JJ and I'm

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.780
a Senior Product Manager at [inaudible] focused on the agent experience.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.850
I was the Data Product Manager at Apple,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.550
VSCO and Collective Health in a past life.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.380
People should take this course if they want to effectively leverage data in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.250
their day-to-day strategic and tactical decision-making as a product manager.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.470
This course is perfect for a data engineer,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.990
data analyst or data scientist that's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.950
yearning to apply their skills towards product management,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.520
or a product manager that just wants to become more data-driven in their decision-making.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.939
One piece of information about this course is that your internal stakeholders

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.050
will oftentimes have many different opinions on what the company should build.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.295
But at the end of the day,

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:06.000
data and user research will ultimately be the deciding factor.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.440
Some career options for people after they complete this course

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.305
are becoming an associate product manager,

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.920
product manager, product analyst,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.950
product operations specialist, data product manager or data program manager.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.155
These skills are important to learn because almost every company

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:40.410
is underutilizing the amount of data they have at their disposal.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.835
Hiring managers look for product managers with a good grasp of SQL and they know-how,

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:57.590
how to whip up raw data into actionable insights for product presentations.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.350
I love working with a small team that builds

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
products to make people's lives more fulfilling and efficient,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.055
whether they're musicians, photographers,

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:17.270
customer experience agents, or just anyone who has a problem worth solving.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.925
If you're currently employed in a company but not in a product manager role,

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:32.315
you can still build up your product management chops on the job.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:33.849
You find a problem,

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.875
either a customer-facing or internal process issue,

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.350
gather data and use the research to estimate

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.290
the benefits of how much it would impact the business if we

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.210
solved it and pitch that to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.720
internal stakeholders to hopefully get the resources to solve it.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.120
When you enter this field,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.620
you're going to expect that data will always be really messy and unorganized,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.790
and that you'll apply your new found skills to bring order to the chaos.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.415
Every day is a little different.

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:17.950
A particularly diverse day involving typical tasks at

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.255
work involve working with user research and design,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.985
to talk to customers about a new prototype,

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.470
either through Zoom or in person.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.000
After, I usually look through a small queue of tickets that were

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.705
routed in from the customer advocacy team via Zendesk,

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:39.280
which I then through triage looking for any customer request,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.170
either informing them that it's coming up in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.950
a roadmap or asking more clarifying questions in

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.590
the hopes of designing a solution that will not band-aid

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.395
the problem but rather fix it scalably for the long term.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:56.300
I then attend two daily scrum rituals with the engineering teams that I work with,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.465
taking note of the development of our progress.

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:04.480
In addition to taking note of any edge cases that crop up during development.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.830
I may then tier up documentation for

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.345
our APIs based on a change that's about to go out later this week,

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:12.725
and not just showing the glory but I also may attend

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:16.595
a postmortem about a production outage the other day,

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:18.500
discussing with engineering managers,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.220
site reliability engineers and other product managers how we

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.435
can mitigate this particular incident from happening again in the future.

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:30.110
Finally, I may wrap up my day by pulling data from

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.920
Google BigQuery and then visualizing it in Tableau to

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.640
inform a PRD or product requirements document that

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.390
I'm running for a product that will be starting development on in a couple of weeks.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.690
Employers are looking for someone to uncover and communicate

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.120
user market and product insights from raw data without mess or fuss.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.140
The most rewarding thing about working in the field of product management is

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.355
physically seeing your users find delight in the products that you shape,

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:18.050
and that you've led a team to make user's lives better in some way.
