00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.630
What is product management?

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.110
Product management is the art and science of uncovering

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.010
user problems through leveraging data and user research.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.625
Setting objectives and metrics to align cross-functional teams towards common goals.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:23.550
Leading engineers and designers to determine what solutions need to be built.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.980
Finally, facilitating execution and the launch of your products to market.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.395
The first product manager role was officialized at Proctor and Gamble in the 1930s.

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:37.230
The role was described as Brand Man,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.685
responsible for the brand as a product.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.920
They were responsible for advertising, marketing,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.540
and brand product reception via field testing and client interaction.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.000
The roles sat closer to product relations in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.130
marketing as a way to understand customers needs and products.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.835
In the light of the tech boom,

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:58.980
however, there was a shift in the product manager's role,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.010
where experimentation and iterative design involves working a little closer with

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.190
development and design teams to really represent

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.000
and hone in on the customer's needs, wants, and desires.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.650
But then how do data product management come about?

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.355
Due to Moore's Law,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:22.090
which states that overall processing power for computers will double every two years.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.060
Humans are producing more data than we know what to do with.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.250
This has initiated the emergence of a new type of product manager who can represent

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.190
the customer while understanding both the risks and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.730
possibilities that big data processing can bring.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.820
Data product management is still a very ambiguous term in the industry.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.350
Different companies have different requirements and intentions for data product managers.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.785
There are currently three types of data product managers.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:56.765
First, building data products that leverage automated data collection,

00:01:56.765 --> 00:02:00.440
processing, storage, machine learning, and retrieval.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.355
Some examples include Netflix's content recommendation engine,

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:06.740
Spotify's year end review,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.320
and the personal finance app, Mint's budgeting dashboard.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.290
Next, build data platforms that enable data scientists and analysts to access, store,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.920
analyze, enrich, transform, aggregate,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.435
encrypt, visualize, and deliver data.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:30.350
Finally, data product managers that leverage data science to make

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.430
stronger decisions as a product manager from defining the minimum viable product,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.165
to iterative design and experimentation,

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.290
to building out your product roadmap.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.340
For this course, we'll be focusing on this.
