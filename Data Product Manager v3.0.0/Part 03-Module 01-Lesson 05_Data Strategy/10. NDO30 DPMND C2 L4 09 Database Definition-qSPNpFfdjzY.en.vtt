00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
A database is an organized collection of data,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:08.190
generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.825
Database and data warehouse are two different storage types.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.550
It is important for us to understand differences between the two.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.515
DBs are to record data from an application,

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:27.040
whereas data warehouses are to analyze the data of an enterprise.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.185
DBs might store detailed data,

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.780
whereas a data warehouse might have summarized data.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.885
DBs are used for operations and transactions.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:43.345
Data warehouses are used for business data analysis.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.930
DBs get data in real-time,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.485
whereas data warehouse needs to be refreshed to get latest data.

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:54.830
DBs are associated with a single application.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.350
Data warehouse affect from multiple applications.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.565
To summarize it all,

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.675
data warehouse are required to store

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:09.745
large quantities of historical data and provide fast,

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:12.535
complex queries across all the data,

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.760
mostly using all apps.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.390
DBs focus on storing current transactional data to enable

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.935
fast access to specific data for business processes.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.420
This is how OLTPs work.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.740
DBs can be categorized into two major categories: SQL DBs and NoSQL DBs.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.885
SQL DBs are classic category of DBs,

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.999
they store data in tables,

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.395
data is relational in nature,

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.684
can be queried using SQL,

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.825
schemas need to be defined.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:53.844
Schema is nothing but organization of data as blueprint of how the DB is constructed.

00:01:53.844 --> 00:02:00.855
Common SQL DBs are MS SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:07.060
There are four major categories of NoSQL DBs: Document-oriented,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.960
columnar DB, key-value DB, and graph DB.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.945
Document-oriented DBs, they do not have fixed schema,

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.125
data is stored in JSON documents,

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:25.550
each document can have different fields.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.865
Common examples of document-oriented DBs are,

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:33.735
MongoDB, CouchDB, or Document DB.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:37.475
In columnar DB, data is stored in

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:42.770
columns instead of how it is stored in rows in relational DBs.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.390
Column-based queries can run fast on these DBs.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.020
It is much more easier in columnar DBs to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.755
add columns than their counterpart, relational DBs.

00:02:54.755 --> 00:03:00.850
One common example of most popular columnar DB is Cassandra.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.710
In key-value DBs, values are stored with unique keys.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.985
These DBs are much simpler,

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:13.200
scalable for reads and writes.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.440
Example of key-value DBs are Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.835
In graph DBs data is stored as network.

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:28.100
These DBs focus on connections between data points and are

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.525
used for analysis of relationships between data points.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:38.700
Examples of graph DBs are InfiniteGraph and Neo4j.
