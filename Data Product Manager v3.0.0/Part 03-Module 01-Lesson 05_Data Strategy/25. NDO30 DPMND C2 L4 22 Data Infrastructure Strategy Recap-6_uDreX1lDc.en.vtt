Wow, we have covered a lot in this lesson.

You can now decide on processing pieces.

You can strategize on when you need to use ETL and when you want ELT.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.650
You know all about data storage.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.755
You should be able to differentiate between a database,

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.840
data warehouse, or data lake,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.795
and select the relevant data storage piece.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:30.915
You should be able to apply strategic nuances for making infrastructure decisions,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:37.020
and oh, don't forget most important thing, security and compliance.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.400
You can now ensure that you are in compliance while dealing with various types of data.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.030
