00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Challenges with ELT pipelines.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:05.580
ELTs can be expensive.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.195
ELT pipelines generally deal with huge volume of structured and unstructured data.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.365
Scalability is a necessity for ELT pipelines.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.625
If data storage and data processing are a concern,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.030
ELT might not be the solution.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.540
ELT is new kid on the block.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.805
ELT is less mature and less reliable than ETL.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.250
It is still evolving.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.315
It is hard to find resources and expertise in this domain.

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:47.510
Some corner cases of ELT could be moving huge volumes of data comes with the risk.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.380
ELT designs have to be scrutinized and should

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.625
follow stringent standard to avoid security risk.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:03.035
Companies are regulated with various security standard such as GDPR, HIPAA or CCPA.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:10.410
Removing, masking, or encrypting data might be harder in an ELT model.
