00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.550
We are almost there.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.410
You have come really far.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.675
You have learned about data pipelines,

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.745
next you explored data requirements,

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.675
you delved into gathering and understanding data needs of data consumers.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.285
Your next destination was data producers.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.955
You explored different sources of data,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:19.890
types of data producers,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.275
and type of data they were producing.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.680
You also learned about entity data and even data,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.245
This lesson we'll touch on certain aspects we have not yet looked into.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:39.515
This lesson will help you put all the pieces of data infrastructure puzzle together.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.385
In this lesson, we will talk about,

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:46.545
processing pieces, ETL versus ELT.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.345
We will also talk about,

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.685
when do you need to transform data before loading,

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:55.000
and when it is better to load data first.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.740
Next we will discuss data storage.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.205
What database or data warehouse or data lake mean.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:05.390
How do you select a DB,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.920
or how do you select a data warehouse or data lake,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.295
and when to choose which type of storage.

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:16.435
After that, we will discuss strategy piece of it.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:18.150
When do you build Tech?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.870
When should you buy it?

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.930
What should be the use case for open source,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.390
and when using commercial is better?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.780
How should you choose between Cloud or on-prem?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.430
Then to insource and then to outsource?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.160
We'll wrap this course and lesson with most important topic,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.610
and that will be security and compliance.
