00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
That's it. You are at the end of the course.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm so glad you made it.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.455
You're just about ready to be able to implement a data strategy in the real world.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.910
First, we'll recap what we have covered so far.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.294
Data pipelines, what are data pipelines,

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.065
and what are the components of data pipelines.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.520
Next, we talked about data consumers,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.094
type of data consumers,

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:28.185
and data use cases of data consumers.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.050
After that, we covered data producers,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.730
type of data producers,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.825
and different types of data.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.560
In our last lesson,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.644
we applied our data strategy,

00:00:38.644 --> 00:00:41.825
in which we discussed data processing strategies,

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.310
data storage choices, data infrastructure strategy,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.260
and security, and compliance
