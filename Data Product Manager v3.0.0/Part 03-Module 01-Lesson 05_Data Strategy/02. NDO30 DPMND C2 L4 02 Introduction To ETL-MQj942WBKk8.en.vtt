00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Data processing is generally the collection and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.645
manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:12.900
In simple words, converting data to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.655
a format in which it can be consumed is data processing.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.240
There're strategies around how it can be done.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
For that, you need to learn what extraction,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.750
loading, and transforming mean.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.720
Extraction. Data extraction is the act or process of retrieving

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.685
data out of data sources for further data processing or data storage.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:45.590
In simple words, deriving data from different sources is extraction.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.300
As you already know,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.790
there are many types of data producers.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.820
You might need to get data from a relational DB, from flat files,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.800
from XML files, or other sources depending on what your data requirements are.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.415
You will fetch data from various sources.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:08.450
Transformation. Once data is extracted,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.380
a series of rules or functions are applied to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.495
this extracted data in order to prepare it for loading to the end target.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.135
In transformation step, there could be

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:24.470
restructuring of data to match destination requirements.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.965
Destination could be a data warehouse or any other type of data consumer.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:35.885
Loading. Loading is simply putting or loading data to the end target.

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:41.335
End target could be a CSV flat file or a data warehouse.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:47.915
You might be loading data to a data warehouse that might be used for all lab needs,

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:53.705
or you might be loading data do a data lake used by data scientists.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:59.825
The first processing strategy that we will explore will be ETL.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.335
ETL stands for extraction,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:06.515
transformation, and loading of data.

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:09.574
In this type of processing pipeline,

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:13.655
data is first extracted from various sources,

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:17.900
after that, transformed and loaded to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.705
a database or data warehouse from where it is pulled for analysis.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:25.305
ETL processing pipeline.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.640
This is what an ETL processing pipeline will look like.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.600
Your data might come from your connected devices,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.225
from your data stores,

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.850
your mobile app or website,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.530
or you might have data on Cloud.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.785
All this is extracted,

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:45.905
put in a staging area.

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:52.525
Staging area is nothing but an intermediate storage area where transformation happens,

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.935
and the transformed data is loaded to a data warehouse.

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:03.800
This data in the data warehouse is ultimately used by various data customers.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.700
Then the concept that is important to understand is

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.110
batch processing and stream processing. Batch processing.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.650
Processing massive data with scheduled jobs at once is batch processing.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.360
This works really well in scenarios where a periodic processing of data is needed.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.340
A good example is processing salaries of employees every week,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.415
or e-commerce platform generating invoices for the vendors every month.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:42.230
Another type of processing is done in almost real time.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.169
As data comes, it is processed,

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.375
or as the streams of data come together, they are processed.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:52.135
This is called stream processing.

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:58.024
Stream processing examples will be payment processing and fraud detection.

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:00.785
These two have to be done in real time.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:03.570
That is, when they happen.
