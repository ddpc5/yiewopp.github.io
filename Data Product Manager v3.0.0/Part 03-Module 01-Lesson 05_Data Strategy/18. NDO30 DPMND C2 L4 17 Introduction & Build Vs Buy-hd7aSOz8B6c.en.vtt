00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
Setting a data infrastructure is cost and time intensive.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.394
It is important to consider the strategic pieces while making those choices.

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:16.229
In this section, we will explore this aspect of making data strategic decisions.

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:19.455
There are various aspects of a business.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:26.200
It may not always be wise to build solution for every problem you have in-house.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.080
To put it differently,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.860
the ending shop that is going online,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.280
what should be their core competency and focus?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.705
Should they build an accounting software in-house to maintain their books?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.895
When you should build and when you should buy is a strategic decision.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:50.005
Amazon is fundamentally e-commerce company but it focuses on being a tech leader.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.200
It has invested heavily in hiring the right talent

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.075
and establishing infrastructure to develop some of the technologies in-house.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:03.890
This has given them a competitive advantage over their competitors.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.845
Amazon was able to spin out

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:13.120
a completely new and very profitable business because of this AWS.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.520
Uber, another tech leader and innovator,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.185
has also invested heavily in talent and infrastructure.

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.525
But at some point they realized,

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:26.870
they should not waste their resources in solving

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.110
problems that others have already solved.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.225
They don't need to be an expert on everything.

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:38.595
Also not working with partners slowed their growth.

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:40.695
When should you build?

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:46.255
When time commitments are critical and vendors are not able to honor that.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:49.270
You should build if total cost of building,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.865
including development cost, testing,

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:55.525
configuration, scaling along with talent,

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.310
and infrastructure, is much lower.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.610
You might be better of building

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.305
the solution if deep understanding of your business is needed.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:10.580
You should also build when cost of customization are huge.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.560
It is always best to build your application if there

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.235
is strategic importance associated with it.

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:19.900
When should you buy?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.745
If it'll take you too long to build.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:27.955
When overall cost, which is licensing, implementation, integration,

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.570
customization along with support,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.910
and infrastructure, are much lower.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.375
It is always good to buy market available solution for

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:43.624
problems that are common across enterprises, example HR solutions.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:47.045
Some of the problems have already been solved

00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:50.635
and there are market leaders available with solutions.

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:54.494
It's wise to buy such tech, for example,

00:02:54.494 --> 00:03:00.680
buying cloud storage on AWS or on Azure would be better than building it.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.710
Buying some of the tech solutions helps you scale

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.800
quicker and reduces your speed to market.
