00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.465
Classic example of ETL is building OLTP and OLAP pipeline.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.990
In this case, data requirements are clearly known,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.335
and hence ETLs are a good choice.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.285
ETLs might not be able to scale where data volume is huge.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:25.230
Example on Instagram, 95 million photos and videos are shared per day.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.670
We could not process all this data using ETL.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.260
However, if a subset that is a very small set of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.079
this data that too relational in nature needs to be analyzed,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.290
ETL can be used for that.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.190
It's very clear from our discussion,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.979
ETLs work best in scenarios where data is structured.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.000
Few examples would be online transaction,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.950
customer records, inventory records.
