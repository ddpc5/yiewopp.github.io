00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
A data lake is a system or repository of data stored in its natural raw format,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.510
usually object blobs or files.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.815
A data lake is usually a single store of all enterprise data

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:19.140
including raw copies of source systems data and transformed data.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.390
That was a long definition.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.250
Why can't we make it simpler?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.665
Here is the broken down definition of what data lake is.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:30.340
It is repository of data.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.165
Stores data in natural form.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:37.460
Is usually a single store for all enterprise data.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.620
Is used for reporting,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.870
visualization, advanced analytics and machine learning.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.790
Has structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.160
Here's an illustration of a data lake.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920
It is getting social media data,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.040
multimedia data, and structured data such as customer records.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.965
Data is extracted and loaded to data lake.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.460
From here, it is selected,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.940
organized, and transformed as needed.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.425
Some of the advantages of data lakes are,

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.670
vast amount of data can be stored in data lakes.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.945
Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:32.675
Another advantage of data lakes is processing before loading is not required.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.075
This reduces the turn around time,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:39.740
the time between when data was generated and when it was used.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.410
A very important aspect of data lakes is they are highly agile.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.265
Like data warehouse, data lakes do not have strict data format requirements.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.785
This means any new source of data can be quickly

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:58.700
added or changes in data source can be quickly absorbed.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.550
The concept of data lakes is still new compared to data warehouse.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.190
What this means is expertise is not easily

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.315
available and infrastructure choices are not very many.

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.094
Another limiting factor is data governance.

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:20.310
Data governance is ensuring data quality standards are adhered to.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.850
Due to it's free-flowing image,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.355
people might get lags in monitoring quality of data around data lakes.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:32.210
Data lakes are low cost storages that might

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.580
encourage organizations to accumulate unnecessary data.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.905
One more concern with data lakes is around data privacy.

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:47.060
When huge amount of data is moved across the organization are stored in one place,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.260
it can be risky.
