00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
When to use data lakes.

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:07.050
Data lakes can be used for experimental analysis of data,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.175
where you are still not sure and want to have

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:16.455
a proof of concept before investing in an end-to-end data pipeline.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:22.395
ELTs make it easy to use data lakes for such experimental analysis.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:29.460
Cybersecurity data collection and analysis is a great use case of data lakes.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.615
For any enterprise devices such as laptops,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.500
servers, cloud computing devices,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.925
and virtual systems are all vulnerable.

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:42.725
Add connecting devices to this mix,

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:49.000
it becomes a big data problem that can be solved using data lakes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.890
Data lakes can be used to build

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.215
customer data platforms to provide rich customer insights.

00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:03.695
Data for such platform can come from various sources such as customer profile DBs,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.690
web and mobile events,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.430
brick and mortar systems,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.970
loyalty systems, and service center data.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.140
This data can be of any type: structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.230
Data lakes work best for such use cases.
