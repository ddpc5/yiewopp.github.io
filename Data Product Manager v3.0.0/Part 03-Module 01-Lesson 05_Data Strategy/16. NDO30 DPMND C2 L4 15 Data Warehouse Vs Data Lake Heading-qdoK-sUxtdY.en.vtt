00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Data warehouse have defined the data requirements,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:07.155
while data lakes do not have any such requirements.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.085
Data warehouse work best with structured data.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.535
Data lakes can be used for all sorts of data.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.310
Data warehouse wall has matured.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.030
It has been out there for a few decades now.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.435
Data lake is a relatively new and tech is still maturing.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.580
After data is processed,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.324
it is loaded in data warehouse,

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:33.375
whereas raw data can be loaded in data lakes.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:39.045
Data warehouses are much less agile compared to data lakes.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:45.955
Data warehouses are expensive storages compared to data lakes which are cheaper.

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:50.915
Data warehouse serve use cases of business professionals,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:54.250
whereas data lakes help data scientists.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.540
When should you use data warehouse and when should you use data lakes?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.055
When you have unstructured and structured data

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:07.855
from various company data sources use data lake.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.700
When you have historical data that has been

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.835
structured to fit a relational database schema,

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:16.405
use a data warehouse.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:22.525
When you need cost-effective big data storage, use data lake.

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:30.185
When you need to store data to run analytics for business decisions, use data warehouse.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:34.905
Data lake users are data scientist and engineers.

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:39.625
Data warehouse users are data analyst and business analyst.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:43.930
Data lakes are good for storing huge data and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.815
big data analytics like deep learning and real-time analytics.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:53.920
Data warehouse are good for smaller set of data compared to data lake and are

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.535
used for typical read-only queries that aggregate and summarize data.

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:04.055
Data lakes store all data that might be used.

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.015
It can take up to petabytes.

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:11.850
Data warehouses store data that is relevant for analysis.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.765
Neither is better.

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:17.420
There are specific scenarios for each one.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.340
Most enterprises adopt a hybrid approach.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.815
Where they catch all their data in a data lake,

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:31.500
and build ETL on top of it and that ETL fits to a data warehouse.
