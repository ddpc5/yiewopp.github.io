00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.075
especially data storage and computing power without direct active management by the user.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:14.520
The term is generally used to describe

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.430
data centers available to many users over the Internet.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.920
By on-prem or on-premise is referred to building and owning

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
computing infrastructure within the physical confines of an enterprise.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.085
General Electric is a good example in this regard.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.430
This started using AWS and now have

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.890
a Cloud solution of their own which is Predix platform.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.645
If you go to this site,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.885
you can see how Cloud is helping them strategically.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.920
It says, "Reduced cost.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.665
Speed to innovation.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.270
Global visibility.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.745
The potential benefits of Cloud adoption are not only many,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.030
but they are tough to ignore."

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.365
Many small enterprises are still operating on-prem.

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:06.260
They want to tightly control their ecosystem.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.110
Security is a concern for them.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.530
Cost structures are complicated for Cloud.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.765
A small business might fear features like

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:19.505
auto-scaling not knowing what bill they get at the end.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.940
Cloud needs a sound network.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.825
Many places and many companies still do not have the best networks.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.200
A recent article said,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.039
"When asked about adopting an enterprise Cloud computing platform,

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.040
66 percent of IT professionals say security is the greatest concern."

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.130
When to use Cloud?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.820
If you need scalability and agility for quick deployments.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.555
If you need accessibility from anywhere.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:55.075
If you want to have low infrastructure costs in long-term.

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:59.995
If security and compliance are not your biggest concerns.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:04.790
If you need an always available support model.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.340
Moving to Cloud frees up your resources and you can focus on innovation.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.775
You might want to use on-prem if: total cost of ownership is lower,

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:22.630
if uptime is a concern and your on-prem solution provides you better uptime,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.060
you want control and governance in your hands,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.525
when you have latency concerns because your data is just

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:33.865
everywhere across zones, on-prem, etc.

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:37.490
Ingress is traffic going out of the ecosystem,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.905
egress is traffic entering it.

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:45.845
If you need huge amount of data to be transferred between Cloud and on-prem constantly,

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.555
that is, ingress at egress is high,

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.660
Cloud might be expensive for you.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.730
You are better off being on-prem.
