00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
Open source software is a type of computer software in which source code is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.565
released under the license in which the copyright holder grants users the right to study,

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:16.545
change and distribute the software to anyone for any purpose.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.620
A very common example would be Linux.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.770
Commercial software is a software that is build by

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.265
a person or group to be sold at a price.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.725
Depending on software and price,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.605
source code may or may not be bought.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:35.145
Windows is a good example of commercial software.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.585
Google is poster child of open source world.

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:42.420
They are building community around it.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.425
It helps them with innovation.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.470
Some of the best minds work and contribute to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.820
your tech and you do not even have to pay them.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.440
How involved you are with open source also influences your brand image.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.540
Google also has a vision statement around open source.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.070
Google believes that open source is good for everyone.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.995
By being open and freely available,

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:15.335
it enables and encourages collaboration and the development of technology,

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:17.785
solving real world problems.

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:22.250
There are good reasons for companies to have commercial solutions.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.175
If we talk about Microsoft Azure,

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:28.465
it has 10,000 IP patents.

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:30.010
What this would mean,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.930
if you are using Azure Solutions,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.880
a professional hacker might not know the inter cases of how it might work.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.915
This could be an added advantage and might provide you a security blanket.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.240
Open source are available to anyone while you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.105
need resources to buy a world class software solution.

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.880
It helps in creating barriers for

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.375
new competitors to come and quickly replicate what you are doing.

00:01:56.375 --> 00:02:00.425
Azure is well aware of disadvantage that they have.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:03.150
They say "Reduce risk,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.280
innovate with confidence, and operate with freedom in the Cloud.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.860
Azure IP Advantage provides

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.275
the industry's most comprehensive protection against intellectual property risks. "

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.610
When to use open source.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.900
If the wheel has already been invented,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.990
when it is well supported by community,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.155
when total cost of ownership is low,

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:30.050
when it aligns with what your brand stands

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.835
for and when in need source code not just the application.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:36.905
When to use commercial?

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:41.420
When total cost of ownership is high for open source,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.420
if security is a big concern,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.150
if it is easier to adapt,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.520
if it is an industry standard solution like spreadsheet that everybody uses,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.070
when you need a reliable support.
