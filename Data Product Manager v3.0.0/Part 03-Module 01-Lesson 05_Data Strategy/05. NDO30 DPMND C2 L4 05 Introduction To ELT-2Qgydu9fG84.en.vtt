00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Two major changes that have influenced data processing requirements are,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.570
new data storage technologies that no longer expect data to be

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.910
delivered in a specific format unlike data warehouse.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.425
Second, point of processing has improved tremendously.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.410
Processing is quicker and faster.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.700
That means we do not need to process data in advance,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.835
or break down jobs to get them done in time.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:34.125
This is led to businesses creating ELT pipeline,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.455
which is our second strategy of creating processing pipelines.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:44.865
ELT, extraction, loading and transformation.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:50.720
In ELT pipelines, data can be extracted from various data sources.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.685
This data could be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured.

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.615
Data is loaded in data storage such as a Data Lake.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.865
Any type of raw data can be loaded to Data Lakes.

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:07.295
Data Lakes do not care about the format of data.

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:11.105
Transformation is still required before data can be used.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:15.240
This happens after data has been loaded in a Data Lake.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.095
In ELT pipelines, data can come from various sources.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:23.735
First, data is extracted from these sources,

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:27.520
then it is loaded into a data storage such as Data Lake.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.810
After loading, transformation can happen.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.060
There might be ETL pipelines,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.480
built from that Data Lake to data warehouse.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.640
They could be application that process data on demand,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.590
depending on the consumers need.
