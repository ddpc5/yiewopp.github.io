00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.675
This definition from AWS website very well explains what data warehouses are.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:14.505
They are central repository of information analyze and used to make informed decisions.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.530
Data flows into data warehouses from various traditional data sources,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.765
such as transactional systems,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:27.360
relational DB's, or other resources generally on regular cadence.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.695
Here we can clearly see how data warehouses are used.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.230
They get data from various sources.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.015
There is an ETL Pipeline that feeds data to data warehouse,

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:43.140
and data warehouse powers applications such as reporting,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.595
visualizations and BI or business intelligence.

00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:51.680
In data warehouses, data is consolidated at

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.045
one place which speeds up reporting and analysis.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.745
Imagine getting data from 10 different DB's,

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:02.145
merging it, massaging it.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.280
Data warehouse saves us from those hazards.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.435
Data is enriched, multiple dimensions are added to data

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:17.330
as data from different sources is blended to provide better and deeper analysis.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.050
This helps in better business intelligence and better decision making.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.580
Imagine C-suite making decisions only after looking at marketing data or operations data.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.190
Data warehouses help in minimizing blind-spots.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.510
Data warehouse also forces on data discipline in

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.285
the organization which results in improved data quality.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.959
Since it expects data in a specific format,

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.920
groups and organization within an enterprise need to make

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.725
sure that their data can be provided to data warehouse with minimal overhead.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:02.810
Hence, they follow data format guidelines of data warehouses.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.050
Data warehouses could be costly.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.235
All the data sources need to be hooked to ETL Pipelines and this will require,

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:16.880
continuous cleaning, transformation and data integration cycles,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.720
making data warehouse ecosystems expensive.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.480
Processing before data is loaded,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.850
makes data warehouses nonviable for real time use cases.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.755
A marketing campaign cannot be monitored in real time using data warehouse data,

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:40.440
format requirements make it harder to add a new source of data to data warehouses.
