00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.030
Data that is stored in storage device and is not actively used is called data at rest.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.260
Storage device could range from data-center to flash drive,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.835
but just do it on Cloud or on your computer is data at rest.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.555
Data that is being used is data in motion.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:23.100
Data traveling on Internet and local networks is also the data in motion.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.570
You watch a video on Netflix or You tube,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.720
that is data in motion.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
PII, personal data, also known

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
as personal information or personally identifiable information,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.860
is any information relating to an identifiable person.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.880
Not taking care of customers' PII data can lead to customers identity theft.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.280
In turn, it might have legal and financial ramifications on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.135
your organization and can impact consumer trust and brand image.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:00.615
How to handle PII?

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.000
No local laws and definitions,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.650
identify where all PII is,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.055
is it in data at rest or is it in data in motion?

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.760
Establish data retention policies.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.410
Have data governance and associated controls in place.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.145
PCI DSS.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:30.140
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.800
an information security standard for organizations that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.740
handle branded credit cards from major card schemes.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.045
If you have PCI data,

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.510
you need to follow stringent compliance guidelines.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.610
There will be regular audits,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.605
and if the guidelines are not followed,

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:52.345
there are fines and legal ramifications.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:56.175
Core control objectives of PCI are;

00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:02.870
built and maintain a secure network and systems, protect cardholder data,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.680
maintain our vulnerability management program,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.669
implement strong access control measures,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.195
regularly monitor and test networks,

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:18.015
maintain an information security policy.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:24.605
HIPAA is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.955
This act protects health information of individuals.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:34.175
Some examples of PHI or Protected Health Information are;

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:39.770
medical record numbers, device identifiers, and serial numbers.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.350
HIPAA says any company or individual that comes into

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.660
contact with PHI must enact and enforce appropriate policies,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.145
procedures, and safeguards to protect data.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:58.140
HIPAA violations might lead to termination of job,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.855
sanctions from professional boards,

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:05.520
criminal charges including fines and imprisonment.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.885
GDPR, GDPR is General Data Protection Regulation.

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:15.410
Its focus is data protection of EU citizens,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.485
specifically those of European Union and European Economic Area.

00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:26.750
This act provides more control to citizens over their data.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.480
Non-compliance could result in fines

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.145
up to 20 million euros or four percent of global turnover.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:38.500
For GDPR what should you know?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.570
Know what you have and why you have it.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.290
You should know where it is,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.650
who uses it, and how it is used.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.605
When you have sensitive information,

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:54.650
golden word is encryption.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.130
Data governance can never be a bad choice.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.765
CCPA is California Consumer Privacy Act.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:07.730
This act gives California citizens

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.260
the right to know what personal information is being collected about them,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.540
to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.215
to say no to the sale of personal information,

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:24.515
to access their personal information,

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.575
to have equal service and price,

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:31.040
even if they exercise their privacy rights.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.945
Words of wisdom, as Stephane says,

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:39.025
''Digital freedom stops where that of users begins.

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:42.950
Nowadays, digital evolution must no longer be

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.950
offered to a customer in trade-off between privacy and security.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.980
Privacy is not for sale,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.320
it's a valuable asset to protect.''
