00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.414
Choose your data storage elements.

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:06.495
You already know what all structured data knapsack has.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:12.600
You also know the semi-structured or unstructured data knapsack is collecting.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.095
For entity data that is relational in nature,

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.480
SQL DBs are best.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.555
For event data that has no schema,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.864
can change often and quickly,

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:27.030
and can be stored as JSON documents,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.420
we will use document-oriented DB.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.430
For server request and responses that are semi-structured,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.290
have no fixed schema,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.415
and each data point can have different fields,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.940
also we can store them in JSON documents,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.020
document-oriented is best choice.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.520
Customer reviews, and product mentions can be easily stored as key-value pair,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.375
and unstructured in nature.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.870
For this data, we will use key-value DB.
