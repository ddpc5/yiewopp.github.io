00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
When to use ELT.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.090
One use case of ELT could be when source and target database are of same type,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.185
example being Oracle source and Oracle target.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.740
You might do unnecessary processing before loading data

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.745
from Source Oracle db to Destination Oracle db.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.175
When data volumes are huge,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.540
you do not want to process anything and everything under the sun.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.005
The reality is for most enterprises,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.775
data volumes are huge,

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:37.740
hence ELTs might work better as they wont become bottlenecks.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.400
Consider this data, for Wikipedia,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.940
it has almost six million articles and gets 22 billion monthly paid views.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.410
Amount of even data generated on Wikipedia pages would be huge.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.140
ELT by plans will work better in such scenarios.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.025
Again, reemphasizing some of the things I have said so far,

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:09.700
ELTs are better when you have a mixed type of data.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.625
For your use case of customers sentiment analysis,

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.850
when you have data from user reviews,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.625
e-mails, customer care chat scripts,

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.380
ELT will look better.
