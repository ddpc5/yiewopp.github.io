00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
Stepping back, data warehouses are needed to make informed business decision.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
So what are some of the major use cases of data warehouses?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.830
Multiple databases across the organization,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.445
large databases, and lots of historical data.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.945
Data warehouses are best for data mining in such scenarios.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:26.865
For use cases such as market research analysis,

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:31.920
when large volumes of data is needed to do in-depth analysis,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.605
and multiple dimensions of data help,

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.080
data warehouses fit the bill.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.065
User behavior analysis could be another use case for data warehouses.

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.110
Again, large volume of data is needed,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.929
and data is needed from multiple sources.
