00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
As data product managers,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.525
our work is never done.

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.085
Once a product is released,

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.070
we analyze data to understand how a product is

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.900
performing and to look for opportunities to improve the product and features offered.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.270
These findings lead to product updates,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.805
which leads to a new wave of analysis and feature design.

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:24.165
To iterate is to perform an action repeatedly by repeatedly evaluating,

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.090
designing, and implementing changes to our product.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
Good product managers embrace the process of iterative design.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.325
By leveraging data during the iterative design process,

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:38.930
we can quickly identify the most important areas to focus our attention on during

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.450
these cycles of iterative design to ensure

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.750
our product has a largest possible appeal to customers.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.425
The classic cycle of iterative design is quite simple.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:49.805
To kick off a cycle,

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:51.925
you must design something.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.290
In the case of a data product manager,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.230
this may be a product or a feature for a product that

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.090
leverages large amounts of user data to improve the user experience.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.960
For example, a data product manager for music playing app might work

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.150
on creating a feature that recommend similar music to other songs a user has played.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.250
After the feature is designed,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.175
it can be put in place or implemented.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.915
For a data product manager,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:22.220
this can mean creating a prototype to put in front of users for feedback or

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.595
launching an AB or multivariate test that exposes the new design to a portion of users.

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:30.350
Once the new design has been put in front of others,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.425
it is time to evaluate the performance of the design.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.300
As a data product manager,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.730
this may mean analyzing conversion funnels and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.210
usage data to look for areas a design can be improved.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.065
As data analysis suggest ways that our design can be made stronger,

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.800
we return to the design stage and begin implementing changes based on

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790
our findings and the cycle of iterative design continues.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.530
As data product managers,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.680
it can be helpful to dig deeper into the design implement

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.465
evaluate stages by leveraging the steps of design thinking.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.275
For a data product manager,

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:06.050
the design thinking cycle expands on the cycle

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.930
of iterative design by laying out three stages and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.340
six steps that highlight

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.825
data-driven best practices for changing or creating features and products.

00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:17.075
Design thinking has a long history,

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.670
but the cycle of design thinking became formalized in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.475
the 2000s as a Stanford Business School of Design,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:27.205
or D.School, made teaching design thinking a central focus of their programs.

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:31.580
The first stage in the cycle of design thinking is understanding users.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.200
This includes empathizing with users by researching their wants and needs.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.660
This involves analyzing quantitative data

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.040
as well as talking with customers to gather qualitative data.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.940
After the empathize step,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.775
the next step is define or combining all research to define a user's problems.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:53.045
After the understand stage comes the explorer stage,

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:56.809
which is where different ideas for meeting a user's needs are explored.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.705
The first step in explore is ideation,

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:03.785
which is when product managers and designers can think broadly and generate

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:08.155
a large list of potential ideas they might build to meet the user needs.

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:10.445
Once many ideas have been generated,

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.730
a few that seem like a best fit could be prototyped.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.100
Data product managers often prototype

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.560
very large changes to seek feedback before committing development resources.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.935
Then the design thinking cycle enters the materialize phase.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:29.365
The first step in the materialize phase is to test the change.

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:34.130
The testing phase may include getting feedback on the prototype from actual users.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.230
The testing step can also include running

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.030
experiments by exposing some live users to the new feature.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.885
Finally, after testing the designer feature is implemented for all users,

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:46.250
if it was successful.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.525
With the feature launched,

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.690
a product manager will continue to analyze usage data and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.385
reach out to customers to find users and areas that can be improved.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:56.760
With this, the cycle begins again.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.550
By following this cycle,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.830
product managers leverage data to drive

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.710
the creation of the most appealing product for users.
