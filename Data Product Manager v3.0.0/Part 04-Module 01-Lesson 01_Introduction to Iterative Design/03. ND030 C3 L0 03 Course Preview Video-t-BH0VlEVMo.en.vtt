00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
Let me outline what you'll learn in each lesson in this course.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:05.895
In the first lesson,

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.435
you'll learn about iterative design, its history,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.464
and why it is so important to data product managers,

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.300
will also explore the business stakeholders

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.850
you'll be working with as a data product manager.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
Finally, I'll discuss the final project you'll tackle in this course.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.045
In lesson 2, you'll learn about key performance indicators or KPIs,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:31.455
including choosing and calculating KPIs for products that are live in field.

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:34.805
We'll first learn about KPIs for different business models.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.890
Then we'll discuss how to calculate

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.430
common key performance indicators that measure user acquisition,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.205
activation, retention, and revenue.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:48.835
Finally, we'll cover how to ensure you have the data you need to measure your KPIs.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.955
In lesson 3, we're going to talk about user conversion bundles,

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:56.105
including how to measure user drop-off between steps,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.080
and how to visualize funnel drop-off in tableau.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.220
By analyzing user funnels,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.765
you'll learn one way to reveal potential opportunities for product improvement.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.020
Using data to identify areas for improvement is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.655
an important step in the cycle of data-driven iterative design.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.965
In lesson 4, we'll cover segment analysis,

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.990
including how to divide users into

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.160
cohorts or segments that share similar characteristics.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.660
How to identify attributes in your data for use in user segment analysis,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.170
and how to apply cohorts and segments to funnel and feature usage analysis.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.455
By looking at product data broken into user segments,

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.365
you'll be able to identify opportunities to engage

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:39.880
and improve user experience for different types of users.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.225
In lesson 5, we'll dive into qualitative and quantitative data,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:47.060
including methods for collecting qualitative data and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.110
integrating data into the iterative design process.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.640
We'll also discuss using the jobs to be done

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.835
theory to better understand customer desires.

00:01:55.835 --> 00:02:01.390
Finally, we'll learn about using the RICE framework to prioritize product improvements.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.890
The sixth and final lesson in this course focuses on A/B and multivariate tests,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.475
including how to choose an appropriate test for a given situation,

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:12.770
how to track data during a test,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.570
and how to evaluate a test results for statistical significance.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.900
Experiments like A/B and multivariate tests allow product managers

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.204
to know with confidence whether a new feature results in desired outcomes.

00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:26.990
Designing and launching tests is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.140
an important step in the cycle of data-driven iterative design.
