00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
In this challenge, groups of four to six people are given

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.975
15 minutes to build the tallest possible tower with a marshmallow on top.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:11.055
Their supplies: 20 sticks of spaghetti,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:12.600
one yard of tape,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.160
one yard of string,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.990
and a single marshmallow.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.105
In one version of the experiment,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.440
which has since been replicated many times,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.255
the first day of testing challenge groups of preschool students.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:28.890
On the second day, the groups were made of graduate students from a business school.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.740
The business school students spent the first 10 of

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.410
their 15 minutes deciding how to build the tower.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.465
They discussed and debated the various methods before deciding as a group how to proceed,

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:44.150
they spent the rest of the five-minutes building the tower with no time for another try.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.835
In a sense, they designed and then launched with no Iterative testing.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.190
The preschool children, however immediately began

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.450
sticking the marshmallow on the spaghetti to try to build a tower.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.850
By attempting to build the tower and testing the actual design,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.420
the preschoolers got ideas about what would and wouldn't work in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.600
marshmallow spaghetti tape physics because the preschoolers

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.455
repeatedly tested their design and got new ideas on what was working.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:13.370
The teams of preschoolers ended up building much taller towers than

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.435
the Business School students who hadn't embraced an iterative cycle of design.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:21.020
Data allows product managers to make better products because

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.815
the use of data can help identify areas for product improvement.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.860
Iterative use of that data also ensures that

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.695
product managers waste fewer resources because

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.350
iterative design results in product managers testing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.540
potential changes before committing a large amount of work to a potentially bad idea.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.055
If you ever wonder why iterative design is important to data product managers,

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:45.410
just remember that business school students with

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.245
decades of education couldn't build a tower

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.840
taller than the towers preschoolers built when they

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.570
leveraged the power of the cycle of iterative design.
