00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
Congratulations.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.620
You have just finished the first lesson of this course.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.220
In this lesson, we first learned about the stages and steps in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.655
the cycles of iterative design from the classic design,

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.780
implement, evaluate to the design thinking cycle of empathize,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
define, ideate, prototype, test, and implement.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.784
Then we covered the many business stakeholders

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:26.895
a data product manager needs to work with to find success in their role.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.875
In the third part of this lesson,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.320
we learned about the history of iterative design,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.790
especially its roots in software development and spiral design.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.865
In the last part of this lesson,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.880
we discussed the final project for the course and how it will

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.240
ask you to use the skills taught throughout this course to act

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.590
as a data product manager in evaluating the performance of a live app and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.600
analyzing its data to determine the best next step in a cycle of iterative design.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.345
Congratulations on completing Lesson 1.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:59.180
In the next lesson, we'll discuss how to choose and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.090
measure key performance indicators for a live product.
