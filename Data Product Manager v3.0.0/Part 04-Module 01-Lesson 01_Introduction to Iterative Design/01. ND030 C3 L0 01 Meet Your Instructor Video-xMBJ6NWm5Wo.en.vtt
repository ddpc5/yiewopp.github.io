00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello and welcome.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.565
My name is Ann Renason and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:09.870
I have almost a decade of experience in software product management,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.015
including launching and managing consumer and enterprise facing products in the EdTech,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.845
and market research industries.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.430
My focus is on developing agile teams that use data-driven

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.540
decision-making as part of a cycle of iterative product design.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.950
I'm excited to share my knowledge with you.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.575
By the end of this course,

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.560
you'll have learned skills that will help you more effectively build

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.770
products and leverage data to better serve your customers.
