00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
As a data product manager,

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:06.375
you'll act as a connection point across many different types of stakeholders.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.500
Product managers are the glue that binds cross-functional teams together.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.960
Depending on the company or product type,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.245
you might have more stakeholders or different types of stakeholders,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.525
but there are five types of business stakeholders

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:23.415
almost all data product managers will work with as part of their daily responsibilities.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.450
One important stakeholder will be members of the finance and business team.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.550
The finance team will help you measure

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.555
key performance indicators that tie into the financial health of your product,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.685
including revenue, profit margins,

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.875
and user retention rates.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.220
Another important business stakeholder is marketing.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.250
Marketing sells your product to potential customers.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.960
Those in marketing have a great interest in the product

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.780
features you plan to change, upgrade, or add.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.160
If your product also has a sales team,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.480
you'll need to keep them updated on the product road-map as well.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.490
In exchange, sales team members will be able to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.850
provide feedback from real customers about potential features,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.525
while also providing great insight into the competitive landscape.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.870
Another important team is your design team.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.750
Designers can help create a user interface and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.900
user experience that is intuitive to your customers.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.230
They often help with creating simple prototypes for testing,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.625
as well as leading usability testing on more finalized designs.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:27.215
While the design team may help with every aspect of the product a user sees,

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:30.335
data science teammates focus on what isn't seen,

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.140
making your data as useful as possible.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.915
This includes running deep analysis to help you

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.540
understand how to better meet user needs and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.480
perhaps building machine learning models that can be a part of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.940
a user-facing feature to provide even more value to your customers.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.190
Finally, one of the teams you'll work most closely

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.915
with as a data product manager is the engineering team.

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.610
Engineers build and make changes to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.340
a product based on the direction of product management.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.040
The engineering team will also help you instrument

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.280
your product and features so that you can collect the data you need.
