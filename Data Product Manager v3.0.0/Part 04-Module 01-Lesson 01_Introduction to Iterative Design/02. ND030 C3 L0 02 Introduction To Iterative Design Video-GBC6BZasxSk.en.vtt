00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
In data-driven iterative design,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.640
product managers evaluate data to find areas for improvement, design potential solutions,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.250
create prototypes to get feedback from and launch tests with and then return to

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.695
data evaluation to look for more areas to improve and grow user satisfaction.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:20.435
Once a product is launched,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:23.420
product managers get access to a wealth of data,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.100
so much data in fact,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800
that it can be overwhelming.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.910
Which state is the most important?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.355
Which sources should you focus on?

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.975
How can the data be leveraged to improve your product?

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:38.090
Product managers have a limited amount of time,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.250
and those who embrace a data-driven cycle of iterative design can find the answers to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.310
these questions while ensuring their time is spent on

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.120
those parts of the product most likely to determine a product success.
