00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
At the end of this course,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.980
you'll tackle a project that brings together all the skills and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.410
information we'll cover together in our six lessons.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.535
The project brings you back to the flying car app,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.205
Fiverr, that you launched in course 1.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.690
Now Fiverr has been live for six months which

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.520
means you have lots of data to look at to find areas for improvement.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.530
Data product managers spend their days reviewing

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.320
live user data and looking for ways to leverage

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.380
user data to improve a product and its performance in

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.585
pursuit of improving key performance indicators or KPIs.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.860
You will do the same for this product.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.385
First, laying out the KPIs that should define Fiverr success before

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:46.600
diving into quantitative and qualitative data on the Fiverr flight booking experience.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.200
You'll also evaluate the results of a multi-variate experiment and then,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.720
based on the data, propose an experiment to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.690
test your own hypothesis for how to improve the app.
