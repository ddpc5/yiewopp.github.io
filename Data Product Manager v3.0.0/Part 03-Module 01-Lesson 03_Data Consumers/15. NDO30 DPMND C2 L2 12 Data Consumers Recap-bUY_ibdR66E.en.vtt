00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey, congratulations.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.610
You made it to the end of this lesson. So let's recap.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.005
In this lesson, we covered who a data consumer is,

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.610
we discussed different types of data stakeholders within an organization,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.250
explored their data use cases,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.675
and finally learned to identify what data is needed for,

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:25.260
and whether it is entity-based on event-based.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.320
We also did some entity data modeling.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.050
I hope you enjoyed learning about data consumers as much as I loved teaching about them.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.460
See you in the next session where we will learn about data producers.
