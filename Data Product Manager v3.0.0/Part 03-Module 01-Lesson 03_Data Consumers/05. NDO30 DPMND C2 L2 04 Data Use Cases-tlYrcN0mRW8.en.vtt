Now that we have covered identifying data consumer,

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.790
let's talk about the use cases for data.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.445
A data use case is how a group of customers or stakeholders uses data.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:15.540
Broadly, data use cases can be categorized into five buckets.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.535
Let's discuss each one of them.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.365

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:40.085
of data use cases for knapsack data consumers,

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.540
