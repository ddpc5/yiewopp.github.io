00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
These days, sciences this are infiltrating our lives,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.295
and businesses are trying to track every action of a user.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.965
All this is done through event data.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.650
In this lesson, we'll introduce the concept of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
event data and take a deeper look at it in the next lesson.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.680
Event data mainly describes the actions performed by entities.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.070
A few key pieces of information that are captured in

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.835
event data are action, timestamp, and state.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.325
Action is what happened.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.820
Example, customer opened a promotional e-mail.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.805
Timestamp is when it happened,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.835
on evening of October 6th.

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:47.630
Statement refer to all other relevant data such as what device was used,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.924
mobile, tablet, or computer,

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.960
then what browser was used, etc.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.745
Few things to note about event data are,

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.995
data is not normalized.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.914
For every new action more data is generated.

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:09.205
It gives us good insight about how users are interacting with our services over time.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:14.510
Therefore, this type of data is also sometimes referred to as behavioral data.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.665
I hope you'll enjoy learning about entity and event data.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:22.050
Now it's time to test what you have learned.
