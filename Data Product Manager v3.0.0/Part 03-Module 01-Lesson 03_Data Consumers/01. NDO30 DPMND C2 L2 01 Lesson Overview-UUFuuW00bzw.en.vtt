00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Welcome back. Our next destination in

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.675
this exciting journey is the topic of data consumers.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.895
For creating a data strategy,

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:12.030
it is important to understand what data is needed for,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.375
before defining solutions and implementing it.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.830
In this lesson, we will learn who a data consumer is?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.860
We will discuss different types of data stakeholders

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.725
within an organization and after that,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.545
we will explore their data use cases.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:33.870
In the end, we will also learn to identify what data is needed for our use cases,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.095
and whether it is entity based or event based.

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:43.495
Along with that, we will also learn to do entity data modeling.

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:46.805
Along we have talked about data destinations.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:49.160
Data destination are mostly systems,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.325
or storage devices used by data consumers.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.830
Needs of data consumers define data destinations.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.020
We will briefly touch on the topic of systems or types

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.310
of applications while the topic of data storage will be covered later.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.380
So let's make an another exciting adventure to learn about how data is used.
