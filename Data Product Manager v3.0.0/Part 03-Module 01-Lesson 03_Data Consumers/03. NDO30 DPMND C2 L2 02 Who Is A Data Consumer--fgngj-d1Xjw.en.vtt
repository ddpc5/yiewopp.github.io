00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Getting data is great,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.935
but being able to use it is very important.

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.330
To do that, we need to understand who is a data consumer.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.670
A data consumer would be a person,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.755
an organization, or system that uses data for a specific purpose.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.055
Our data consumer can also be a data producer.

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.995
How's that possible? We'll discuss that later.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:28.395
Now let us try to identify some common data stakeholders across businesses.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:33.915
Companies have many different departments and many different types of data stakeholders.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:39.495
These stakeholders might include sales, marketing, accounting,

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.890
finance, engineering, product management,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.140
security and risk, and probably customer care.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.780
Let's break this down a bit.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.165
Sales organizations are responsible for setting up sales targets,

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:58.065
they are the people who sell the product.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:05.390
Tesla sales team will target how many model S3 they want to sell in 2020 and 2021.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.150
For all that, they need to use data.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.010
Marketing on the other hand is about acquiring new customers and retaining old.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.330
Hermes is high-fashion luxury brand.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.425
Hermes marketing team will target customers making purchases in that segment.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.760
For that, they need data.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.260
Accounting is about recording

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.760
the expenses and earnings of a business as they're happening.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.390
For any business, accounting is required.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.100
Some do it in-house,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.125
while others use outside help.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:43.965
Companies like Deloitte and Ernst and Young help businesses with their accounting needs.

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:49.720
What do they need? Data. Finance is about managing the company's wealth,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.150
having a strategy of where to invest,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.895
and having financial predictions around it.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.550
Finance teams work towards creating

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.330
a positive financial outlook to influence investor decision.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.465
Engineering is the group that creates the product,

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:06.665
designs and creates it.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:10.855
For Boeing, they're manufacturing planes, while for Pinterest,

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:12.835
they're creating a website.

00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:15.230
Next, product management.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.970
Product management focuses on the life cycle of a product.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.030
Product management process domain boundaries of technology,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.635
business, and behavioral sciences to understand how magic can be created.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.390
Nobody asked for an iPhone,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.490
well, maybe except for Steve Jobs,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.550
but some great work went into it and they created a magic out of it.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.255
What they all need is data.

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:40.965
Customer care.

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.640
As the name suggests and you might also

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.135
know it is the department that customer reaches out to,

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:50.025
to address grievances or concerns.

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:51.705
They don't need any data,

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:55.695
just kidding. Security and risk.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:01.175
While Paypal security and risk teams make sure all standards are out in place

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:06.850
to secure customers payment information and no fraudulent elements are misusing it,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.015
Hyatt security team will also have to take care of its customers physical security.

00:03:13.015 --> 00:03:16.744
Depending on type of business and context,

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:21.875
security and risk teams might be taking care of different aspects of business.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.530
Well, they don't need any data.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.535
Well, I'll leave up to you to decide.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:32.285
So far what we have discussed is not a comprehensive list.

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:37.295
Different companies might have different departments and corresponding stakeholders.

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:39.815
GE will have manufacturing,

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.730
while Shell will have oil and drilling.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.145
What you need to remember in all of this is that

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:50.135
consumers need data to do their jobs in any department.

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.865
To better understand our data consumers,

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.459
we need to understand,

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.340
how data will be used.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.745
Is it far reporting or building ML models.

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:01.410
What tools will be used?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.170
Excel or Google Data Studio.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.110
Are there any standards within a particular community of users.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.960
Legal might want data differently than accounting or finance.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.075
Also, sometimes you might have to provide the same data in multiple formats.

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:19.955
So we need to know format requirements.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:23.595
Now it's time to put your shine and your knowledge to test.

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:26.640
Please complete the exercises below.
