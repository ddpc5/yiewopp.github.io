00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.255
I hope you had fun thinking about attributes for orders and products. I know I did.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:10.950
There are no fixed rules on what attributes would define what entity.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.980
Attributes of product table could be different depending on product and business needs.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.770
Similarly, what are the data elements we want

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.665
to record also depend on business requirements.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:26.130
I have kept an eraser in mind to build a product table.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.120
Just for fun, I've also added some records to the tables.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.545
For the product table,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.020
I have product ID, shape,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.240
color, costs per unit,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.900
the retail price per unit and SKU number.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.020
For the order table, I have order ID,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.620
date of order, product ID,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.189
which tells us what product was purchased by the customer,

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.540
customer ID that tells us which customer bought the product,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.650
quantity and total order value and tax rate.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.675
It is important to note that I have used product ID and customer

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.540
ID here so that I do not have to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.415
enter the information about product and customer in order table.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.180
In the upcoming concept,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.610
we will discuss this in detail. Shall we continue?
