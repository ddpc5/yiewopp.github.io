00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
In this section, we will discuss the types of data

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.170
needed for a Knapsack, possibility to elements,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.220
and we'll explore if we can do some entity data modeling for marketing,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.175
finance, and customer care use cases.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.410
We know our business goals,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.250
we have [inaudible] that'll be spearheading those and we know what their use cases are.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.505
Our first stakeholder group is engineering.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.300
Their business goal is having a working product.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.020
The use case is monitoring site and app performance.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.515
For that, type of data needed would be event data.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.125
Data elements needed would be,

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.255
event ID, timestamp and event type.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:49.010
Next will be product management team.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.610
Their business goal is improving product and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.615
the use case will be identifying customer pain-points.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:59.650
For that, they will need event data,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.135
and the event data elements they could use would be,

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:08.185
event ID, timestamp, even type and event page.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.315
Marketing wants to retain old customers.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:14.945
Their use case is targeted advertising.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:16.475
They will be needing,

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.565
entity data for that.

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:23.200
Some of the entity data elements that could be useful for them are,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.770
customer name, e-mail, phone,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.125
address, and customer order history.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:32.060
Next comes finance.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.135
They want to predict P&amp;L growth and their use case is monitoring current P&amp;L.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:42.845
The data that will be helpful to them would be entity data.

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:46.820
They would need data elements around cost and price.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.500
They might use aggregated transactional data, number of transactions,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.480
cost of transaction, retail price,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.035
taxes, and the other type of charges.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:03.245
Focus area of logistics team is product delivery.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.395
They want to identify delivery bottlenecks.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:10.605
They would need both event data and entity data.

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:15.755
The event data that could be useful to them might be event ID,

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:21.290
timestamp, event type, parcel number, hop number.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.110
Entity data they might need could be,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.940
parcel number, hop number,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.560
and time at hop.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.080
Next, inventory management team.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.970
They want to have sufficient inventory to achieve that goal.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.405
They want to monitor inventory lead time.

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:41.285
For that they might use both event,

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:43.265
an entity type of data.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:46.375
Data elements that could help them are,

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.040
in event data category,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.375
event ID, timestamp, event type, batch number.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.400
For an entity data,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.530
there will be interested in timestamp when the order was placed,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.285
timestamp when order was dispatched from the manufacturing facility,

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:10.900
timestamp when the order was delivered to the warehouse and batch number.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.285
Finally, customer care team.

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:16.090
They want to address customer grievances

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.760
and provide personalized response to the customer.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.870
They will require entity data for that.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.110
Useful data elements for them could be,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.405
order number, product details,

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:31.610
cost, price, and delivery date.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.795
Entity data modeling.

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:35.679
For marketing, finance,

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.345
and customer use cases,

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:40.450
we'll start with four tables.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.735
Table 1, it stores customer contact information.

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:49.260
Table 2 has customer demographics.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.485
Table 3 contains order details.

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:55.500
Table 4 is about product.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.255
In customer table, we have customer ID,

00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:05.280
first name, last name, address, and e-mail.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.235
Customer demographics has, customer ID,

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:16.695
age, gender, marital status, parental status.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:22.085
Order details has, order ID, date,

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:25.240
product ID, customer ID,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.745
quantity, retail price, tax rate.

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:33.245
Product table has, product ID,

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:39.680
type, color, size, material, and cost price.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.535
Now we'll identify keys.

00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:46.300
Customer ID is primary key for customer table,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.605
and customer demographics table.

00:04:48.605 --> 00:04:52.735
Product ID is the primary key for product table.

00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:57.350
Order ID is the primary key for order details table.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.765
Foreign keys for order detail table are,

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.450
customer ID and product ID.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.865
All other tables do not have any foreign keys.

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:10.410
For targeted advertising, we have to be careful.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.350
It should be delightful and not creepy.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.450
The marketing team will join,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.665
order table with product table and customer demographic table,

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:26.375
to get customer insights and purchase patents by demographic.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:31.550
For example, we might realize that youngsters like cool and funky bags,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.880
while adults prefer functional and professional bags.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.230
We can use this information along with customer information to do targeted advertising.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.090
If John Doe recently created a profile and told us he is 45,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.160
married and have children.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.045
We can send him promotional e-mails suitable for his persona.

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:56.165
Next, for monitoring profit and loss,

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:59.120
we will calculate margin per order,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.065
picking retail price and tax from order data and cost from product tables.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:11.885
This data will be aggregated periodically to create P&amp;L trend over time.

00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:14.015
Please note, for simplicity sake,

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:16.670
I have considered only few elements of cost.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.895
That basic idea remains same.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:24.090
We calculate cost and subtract it from revenue to get profit.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.765
Next, customer care team needs.

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.455
All the history of customer,

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:32.930
what they bought, when they bought it,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.790
that data will be derived by joining order table,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.900
product table and customer table.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.570
This will help customer care team provide personalized responses to the caller,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.055
and this brings us to the end of this section.

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:52.890
Let's bring it all together with one last quiz.
