00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Knapsack has multiple stakeholders,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:06.060
all of them needing and using data for different reasons.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.140
Having a working product is important to the engineering team.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.100
They will be monitoring site and app performance.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.180
Data generated by Knapsack website and app is needed for this.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.360
A good dashboard with alerts will keep the team well informed.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.160
In the future, the team might like to predict loads and breakdowns.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.410
So they will like to have an ML solution.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.525
Improving product is a focus area of product management team.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.660
For this they will be,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.585
identifying customer pain points,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:46.750
and analyze customer interaction data on site and app.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.795
This might be a big data use case as data generated by customer interaction is huge.

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:57.415
Things we'll need to use business intelligence or BI tools,

00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:00.875
and visualization tools to tell stories.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:05.675
Getting new customers and retaining all is the goal of marketing team.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.095
They want to do targeted advertising.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:13.400
We're going to create customer profiles along with preferences.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.675
This data can be used to help customers with virtual assistants.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:20.450
They want all the customer data they can get,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.915
and feeding that into Just Sale.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:27.570
Just Sale then provides a mix on BI, visualization and reporting.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.825
They can create customized marketing content using customer data and just Sale.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:37.415
Predicting Profit and Loss growth is important for the finance team.

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:41.245
They will need to monitor current P&amp;L for that.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:44.360
The finance team is using reports generated by

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.820
simply accounting with details such as daily,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.280
weekly, monthly expenses and earnings.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.400
They feed these reports to their finance tool,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.550
that provides them insights and visualizations.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.770
The tool has an ML engine to help them make future financial predictions.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.210
Smooth product delivery is important for the logistics team.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.855
They need to identify delivery bottlenecks.

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:11.780
The largest is team will need reports around

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.985
how much time every touch point takes in the delivery process.

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:19.215
They will use BI tools for insights,

00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:22.170
and visualization tools for trends.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.480
Sufficient inventory is the focus of the inventory management team.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.020
They need to monitor inventory lead time for that.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.595
Inventory management team needs to maintain historic data,

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:39.845
and needs to get regular reports on when are those replaced and received.

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:43.825
They have dashboards to monitor current lead times,

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:47.855
and an ML Engine to predict future lead times.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.280
Addressing customer grievances is the core of customer care team.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.530
They want to provide personalized responses.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.984
For that, customer care team needs a solution

00:02:58.984 --> 00:03:02.704
that can aggregate customer data across different sources.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:06.995
It should create visual summary of customer other history.

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:09.525
They have built an in-house solution,

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:13.085
they generates reports and visualizations.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:16.910
As you can see, there is no one fit all solution.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.225
Different stakeholders need different data.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.965
Data use cases span across categories.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:29.100
This brings us to the end of this topic of data use cases.
