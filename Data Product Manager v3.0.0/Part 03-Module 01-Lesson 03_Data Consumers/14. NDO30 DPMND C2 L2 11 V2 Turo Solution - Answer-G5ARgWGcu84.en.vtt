00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.614
You are now an expert on the subject of data consumers.

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:06.435
In this section, we'll bring it all together.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.730
As mentioned in the problem statement,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.520
the Peer-to-Peer Car-Sharing Company,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.605
what will be their business goals?

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:18.869
Focusing on safety and security of car owners and car renters,

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.590
they would want to make sure that they are financially

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.470
compliant and have smooth payment mechanism for car owners and renters.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.150
Safety and security will be the focus of risk and security team.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.945
Financial compliance will be of accounting team,

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.825
and smooth payments of payments team.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.325
To ensure safety and security,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:48.050
risk and security team will be interested in customer and car owners screening.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.134
To ensure financial compliance,

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:55.695
accounting team will be maintaining books and create accurate balance sheets.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:01:01.005
One other aspect of payments will be seamless payments to car owners,

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.735
payments team will focus on that.

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:10.250
For screening, risk and security team will have to have customer data such as name,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.360
contact information, license details.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.015
For car owner, they would like to have name,

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.290
contact information, and car registration details.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.790
Accounting will be interested in knowing all the cost and revenue earned from customers.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.640
Payment teams would like to know account details of car owners,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.600
terms of payments and amount to be paid.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.180
Data needed by all these groups happen to be entity data,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.815
and this data will be stored in relational tables.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:44.520
Entity modeling is a bit complex.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.160
We have customer table,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.875
car owner who is our partner here,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:53.185
we have for them a partner table.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:57.500
We have a table having partner payment information,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.179
a table for car details,

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.045
and a table for booking details.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.385
Let's look at primary keys.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:08.350
For customer table, it is customer ID,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.060
for partner table, it is partner ID,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.330
for partner payment, it is partner payment ID,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.715
for car table, it is car ID,

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:19.615
for booking table, it will be booking ID.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.510
For car owner screening,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.405
risk and security team will combine partner table

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.240
with partner payment table and car table.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.230
The information provided in these tables can

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.920
be combined and used for partner verification.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.520
Fraud algorithms can be built to detect anomalies.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.495
Similarly, customer screening can be done using the information in

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:46.015
customer table along with Facebook and Google login details.

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:49.580
Again, some [inaudible] modeling will be needed that will be

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.525
used for these parameters to detect inconsistencies.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:58.585
Accounting can calculate cost and margins using booking table.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:02.430
From booking total, daily rental cost,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.455
taxes and fees will be subtracted to get margin.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:10.325
All this will be aggregated on monthly and weekly basis

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:14.475
to make financial entries in books, and finally,

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:18.000
payments team will combine data from: booking table,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.775
car table, partner table,

00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:23.045
and partner payment table.

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:29.110
They want to get details of against what payment needs to be made and to whom?

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.105
They will use booking table to get what actually needs to be paid, which is margin,

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:40.025
taxes and fees subtracted from booking total,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:43.590
and this brings us to the end of quiz.
