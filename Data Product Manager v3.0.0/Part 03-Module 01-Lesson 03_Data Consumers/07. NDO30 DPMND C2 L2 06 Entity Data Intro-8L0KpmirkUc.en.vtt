00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
Once we know our stakeholders,

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:05.760
their use cases, we need to identify what data they need.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.730
Is it entity data or event data?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.225
We need to know the difference between entity and event data

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.380
because how they can be processed and stored is different,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.784
and that influences our technology decisions.

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:27.360
Entity data, entity is a unique objects such as customer, product, order.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.275
Attributes are the property that describe it for a customer.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:35.835
Entity attributes could be name, address, email, phone.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:41.150
Data that follows entity data model rules is called entity data.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.420
This might sound like a recursive definition,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.540
but as we discuss this further it will become clear.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.665
Entity data is stored in a table.

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.535
For every entity there is a separate table,

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:59.540
and every table has columns that are attributes describing these entities.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.260
One row is dedicated to record one type of entity.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.065
In our example, John Doe is one record of customer entity and Vaishali another record.

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:12.755
It's time to practice your entity data modeling skills.

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:17.610
