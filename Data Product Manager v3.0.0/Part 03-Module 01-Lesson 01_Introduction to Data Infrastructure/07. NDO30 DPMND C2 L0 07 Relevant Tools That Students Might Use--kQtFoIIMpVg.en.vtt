00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.515
What are the relevant tools that students will use?

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.645
This is a bit tricky question.

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:10.665
What tools you will use in your job is predict team, and company dependent.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.010
The tools I use are OfficeSuite,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.105
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, pretty much everyday.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:23.595
I use SQL Server Management Studio to run queries, and get data.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:26.835
I use Tableau for visualization.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.915
I look at Dashboards created by our engineering team,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.570
and I sometimes query data from Splunk.
