00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.665
I am Vaishali Agarwal ,

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:05.145
your instructor of Data Infrastructure Strategy course,

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:08.155
I'm a Product Manager at Expedia Group.

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:11.420
Crafting this course was a tough challenge.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.970
There are a plethora of resources available when it comes to

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.515
understanding data infrastructure from an engineering point of view.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:24.230
But what project managers need to know is not as clear.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.140
This is a unique course that walks the fine line between tech and business.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.575
I love my journey as an instructor of this course,

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:38.630
and I hope you will enjoy the ride this course is going to take you on.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.150
It's great to actually meet you.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.890
Now, let's have fun.
