What is historical contexts of data infrastructure?

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:10.845
Every single aspect of data infrastructure has evolved tremendously in last few decades.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:17.115
We have come a long way from punch cards and magnetic tapes to Cloud storage.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.045
Data storage has become better and cheaper.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.720
Processing is also faster and cheaper.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.150
Smartphones are way better than any of the computers of 1990s.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.510
The amount of data that is generated is growing

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.205
exponentially and type of data getting generated is constantly evolving.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.265
How do we use and consume data is also changing.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:47.675
All of this has impacted how we think about data infrastructure now,

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.120
versus it was in 1990s.
