When defining a problem, both *qualitative and quantitative data* are considered to narrow down the problems that need to be solved.\n\nIn the Explore stage where different ideas for meeting a user’s needs are explored, the first step is Ideation. Once many ideas have been generated, a few that seem like the best fit will be prototyped. \n\nThen it enters the Materialize stage. The first step in the Materialize stage is to test the prototype. The test step includes obtaining *qualitative data* such as feedback on the prototype from users and obtaining *quantitative data* from the prototype instrumentation. The testing step also includes *running experiments (hypothesis test)* by exposing some live users to the prototype. Product managers then use the *quantitative data or results* from the experiment to confirm the effect of the new feature on the product KPIs.\n\nFinally, after testing, the new design is implemented for all users. With the new design launched, a product manager can continue to analyze *quantitative data* to find trends or areas that are under- and over- performing. With this, the cycle begins again. \n",

The PM team is **ideating** by generating potential features and solutions to the perceived problem.\n\n\n#### 2) What stage of the iterative design cycle should the PM team act like it is in, in regards to the problem of under-booked caterers?\n\nThere is no evidence that the PM team knows why caterers are booked less often than other services. They can make guesses and assumptions based on their own experiences, but they should still be in the **understand** stage of the iterative design cycle because they have not observed customers or talked with them to understand their problems. The team needs to take the step to talk with users and **empathize** before they can **define** the problem users face that results in fewer caterers being booked.\n\n#### 3) Would qualitative data likely be useful at this moment? Why or why not?\n\nQualitative data would likely be very useful at this moment, as qualitative data is helpful when trying to understand the \"why\" behind a users' actions. Since the PM team should be in the understand/define stage of design, they still need to know more about their users' motivations. Talking with or surveying customers who have and have not booked a caterer on the site will provide helpful (qualitative) information about the problems users experience in regards to booking caterers. After they get a better understanding of the \"why\", the PM team can then move into idea ideation and prototyping. Their ideas are likely to be more successful because they will be targeted to address the users' motivations and feelings instead of addressing an assumed problem that may not exist.",

The moderator leads the group in a discussion of topics around a product or feature. \n- Benefits\n - Time-saving: 6-10 people provide opinions at once\n- Drawbacks\n - Limited time to dig into an individual participant’s background\n - Participants can be influenced by the opinions of others\n\n### User interview.\nA user interview is a *one-on-one discussion* with a customer or potential customer. The interview script may focus on the user journey or seek opinions on a potential new feature.\n\n- Benefits\n - Ability to dig deeply into interviewee’s background\n - Interviewee not influenced by others (vs. focus groups)\n\n- Drawbacks\n - Time-consuming (one person at a time)\n\n### Usability testing\nUsability testing is when a user or potential user is asked to actually click through a product or prototype to accomplish a task. The usability tester may be asked to “think out loud” and explain why they are doing certain things and what elements confuse them as they try to reach their assigned goal.\n\n- Benefits\n - Get feedback on actual designs\n - See behavior and usability issues in real-time\n- Drawbacks\n - Only helpful once a prototype exists.",

Optionally, the job might also require locating some way of drying hands.\n*Note: Remember that the steps in a job map should be generic enough that they apply to all customers, not just how a specific customer does the work. For example, a cleaning product/soap is needed for pre-execution, but if the soap is a bar soap or liquid soap doesn't matter for the job map.*\n\n#### 3: Preparation\n\nTo prepare the environment for the job of hand-washing, a person might turn on the water to begin to heat it up to the desired temperature. If using a hand towel, they might also place it near the sink to prevent dripping when going from water to hand-drying during the washing process.\n\n#### 4: Confirmation\n\nTo ensure they are ready for the job of hand-washing, a person will likely re-check that all the required elements are gathered (water, soap). Hand washers also check their hands to confirm they are ready to be washed and don't have anything on their hands that shouldn't be cleaned, such as jewelry that might slip off or a note written in ink. \n\n#### 5: Execution\n\nWhen actually carrying out the job, the hand washer must apply soap and water to their hands. They must also move their hands around to get the cleaning supplies over the entire hands. Then, they must run water over their hands until the hands no longer have any soap on them. \n\n#### 6: Monitoring\n\nTo ensure they are carrying out the job of hand washing properly, the job doer will watch to make sure soap is actually applied to their hands. They may also look for a physical difference in cleanliness if the dirt on their hands is visible.\n\n#### 7: Modification\n\nWhile hand washing, a hand washer might need to adjust the pattern with which they move their hands to clean off any visible dirt or soap. For example, especially dirty or sticky hands might require a longer amount of time or a more intense scrub. Fastidious hand washers or those with especially dirty hands/nails might need to introduce an extra scrubbing tool to the process to be successful in removing dirt.\n\n#### 8: Conclusion\n\nAt the end of the hand washing job, the hand washer must turn off the water and (optionally) dry off their hands.\n\n#### Bonus: Emotional Needs Served\n\nWhen washing hands, a user might serve the emotional need for feeling safer or healthier. They might also be serving the emotional need of showing others that they are healthy people with good habits. Finally, in an environment where hand washing is required (such as a food worker or a doctor at a hospital), there might be an emotional fear of being reprimanded for not hand-washing that motivates the hand washer to perform the act.\n",

One way to prioritize is by using a framework, like the **RICE framework**.\n\n## RICE framework\n- **R (Reach):** the *number of people or customers* a feature is expected to be used by, in a set time period. \n- **I (Impact):** measures the *effect* a new feature is expected to have on KPIs such as conversion rate or customer satisfaction. \n- **C (Confidence):** describes *how sure* you are that your estimates are correct. The more data you have about reach, impact, and effort, the more confident you would be.\n- **E (Effort):** the *amount of time* it will take to make a feature go live, from design to engineering to QA and launch. The effort can be measured in *person-months*, which means the work *one person can do in a number of months*.\n\nOnce you’ve gathered the reach, impact, confidence, and effort scores, you can calculate the **RICE score** for a feature. The feature with the *highest RICE score should be built first*.\n\n```text\nRICE Score = (R * I * C) / E\n```\nOf course, there are many reasons why you might work on a project with a lower score first. The important thing is that, with a scoring framework in place, everyone at your company can clearly identify when trade-offs like this are made.\n\n\n\n\n",

The 5 features are:\n\n- Ability to share individual customer pages via a quick link (for clients to share customer pages across teams)\n- Create line, bar, and pie charts based on collected data (to visualize sales data)\n- Single Sign-On with Social Media Sites (Google)\n- Single Sign-On with Social Media Site (Facebook)\n- Uploading external files to attach as notes to customer pages\n\nTo prioritize, you've worked with cross-functional team members to determine the *reach, impact, confidence, and effort* of every proposed feature. \n- You've talked to your sales team and surveyed existing customers to calculate the *anticipated number of users (reach)* who would be impacted/use the 5 features. \n- You've talked to your sales team, customer support, and surveyed existing customers to calculate the *anticipated impact* of the 5 features. Each feature's anticipated impact could be rated as massive impact (3), high (2), medium (1), and low (.5)\n- You've talked to your sales team, customer support, and subject matter experts to determine the *median confidence* that each feature will have the anticipated impact. Confidence is listed between 0 to 100 (percent). \n- You've talked to your design and engineering leads to determine the level of *effort (in weeks)* for each feature.\n\nUse the RICE framework and the data below to determine the order with which features should be prioritized.\n\n|Feature| Anticipated reach | Anticipated impact | Confidence  |  Effort in weeks |\n|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----------:|:---:|\n|Ability to share individual pages via a quick link| 2000 customers | massive impact  | 50%  |  5 |\n|Create line, bar, and pie charts based on collected data|3000 customers | massive impact  | 90%  |  10 |\n|Single Sign-On with Social Media Sites (Google)|  1000 customers |  medium | 80%  |  3 |\n|Single Sign-On with Social Media Site (Facebook)| 250 customers | low  | 80%  |  2 |\n|Uploading external files to attach as notes| 3000 customers  | high  | 95%  |  8 |\n",

We covered the core functional, related, and emotional jobs and learned how to create a job map to reveal areas for further product innovation.\n\nFinally, we learned about the RICE framework to aid in feature prioritization. By looking at the Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort for each feature, product managers can make better decisions about which feature to build first.\n",

Qualitative data is descriptive data that is observed but typically can't be measured. \n- **Quantitative:** Quantitative data is any data the expresses a count, amount, or range in a numeric fashion. \n- **RICE Framework:** A framework used by product managers to prioritize product work. The framework uses a formula that relies on estimates of product/feature reach, product/feature impact, a metric for confidence in these estimates, and a rough calculation of the effort to build a product/feature.\n- **Usability testing:** A method of product research where a user or potential user is asked to click through a product or prototype to accomplish a task while being observed.\n- **User interview:** A research method where a one-on-one discussion with a customer or potential customer takes place.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- *User Research is Product Management*\nhttps://www.thisisproductmanagement.com/episodes/user-research/\n- *UX Research Cheat Sheet*\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/",
