We’ll discuss what data patterns provide evidence that segments are performing differently and when further research would be a good next step.\n\nFinally, in the third part of the lesson, we’ll learn how to apply user segment analysis to feature usage. As with funnel analysis, we’ll discuss what data patterns provide evidence that different types of users are performing differently. We’ll learn when further research at a user segment level would be a good next step for improving a feature.\n\n## Lesson objective\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n- Explain the importance of segmenting user data\n- Identify behavioral traits in a data set that could be used to analyze user behavior\n- Apply segments to funnel analysis\n- Calculate feature usage within a product, both among all users and among selected segment groups using existing event data\n",

When thinking about how to segment that user data, we can consider three main categories.\n\n* By user **acquisition date (cohort analysis)**. This refers to when the user starts using a product or a feature.\n\n* By **demographic **similarities. Demographics are anything that describes a user as a person, such as income, age, and gender.\n\n- By user’s **behavior** when using a product or feature. This means they ways users use a product such as how often a product is visited or the device used.\n",

Provide a reason that might impact the way a user orders food via a food delivery app. \n\n>- Age: Teenage & college-aged students might order food at different times of day than older adults who are more likely to be working typical 9-5 hours. For example, younger users might order more late at night whereas older users might order more in the 6-8pm dinner window.\n- Device: Different devices provide different layouts and options. Tablets provide more screen area, for example, which means tablet users might spend more time browsing and reading text-based menus.\n- Location: Users in different locations may have access to a different number and variety of restaurants. Based on the restaurants available, the food delivery app may be more or less appealing to users from a certain location. \n\n3. Generate example segment divisions for each selected characteristic. \n\n>- Age - Under 20, 21-25, 26-35, 36-45 and so on.\n- Device - Tablet vs. smartphone vs. desktop.\n- Location - Rural vs. suburban vs. urban.

By placing a dimension from the table into a column or row in Tableau, the number of unique names per dimension will be shown.  In the case of this data file, the columns with bearing on user characteristics/behavior include **Sex**, **Device**, and **Date**. \n\n### Question 2:   List the divisions for each demographic or behavioral segment in the data set.\n\nThe gender segments are **male** and **female**.\n\nThe device segments are **desktop** and **mobile**.\n\nThe dates, which might refer to the date the user was first seen, including dates from **January**, **February**, **March**, and **April** in the year **2015**.\n\n### Question 3:  Which is the largest user segment group? Which is the smallest user segment group?\n\nThe largest segment group is **desktop** users, who represent **60,200** users. The smallest segment group is the monthly number of records, at **22,600** records per month. For user traits, the smallest segment group is **mobile** users, with **30,200** mobile records.",

Product managers who perform such analysis can learn why a difference in performance occurs for different user types and will likely learn valuable information about how to optimize a product.\n\nSegment analysis of funnels follows four basic steps:\n\n1. Create the overall funnel and count the number of users who complete each step. \n\n2. Determine which user segments are available in the data. These user segments are the ones you will apply to the funnel analysis.\n\n3. Calculate the funnel dropoff for each group within a segment. \n4. Look for groups within a segment with a drop off rate that is noticeably higher or lower than average.\n\nIf a particular group of users isn’t getting the experience they need, this will likely be reflected in a drop out at a rate that is higher than average. Once such a pattern is identified, product managers can talk to those users and run experiments to find ways to optimize their user experience.\n\n\n",

Right now the funnel shows the number of users who completed each step.\n\nNote: in this example, the data set only showed the first time any given user went through the funnel. Each user will only ever have taken a step one time. Therefore, we can use the count of users OR the distinct count of users OR the number of unique sessions and get the same result.\n\n**Step 2: determine which user segments are available in the data**\n<br>For this example, let’s look at the segment of devices. By adding the devices to the funnel analysis, we can see the device segment is divided into groups of users on mobile devices and desktop.\n\n**Step 3: calculate drop off for each group in a segment.** \nUse a table calculation of **percent difference** to calculate the dropoff and select **table down**.\n\n**Step 4: look for groups within a segment with a drop off rate that is noticeably higher or lower than average.**\n<br>Looking at the data, we can see mobile users have a 10% lower drop off rate between the search and payment pages than that of the desktop users. They also have a 5% lower drop off rate between the payment and payment confirmation pages than the desktop users. \n\nThe findings may indicate areas for desktop experience optimization. The product manager should talk to users and/or review the desktop design to determine what may be causing the higher drop off rates.\n\n",

Therefore, every page will be shown in the tunnel and every page represents a user taking new action. To calculate the actual drop off, use a Quick Table Calculation of percent change between counts. \n\n#### 1) Determine the drop off rate at each step in the BuyThings.com e-commerce funnel\n\nAdd the behavioral aspect to a row or column view to determine the drop off rate for a given behavior/characteristic.

Which cohorts that have a higher average drop off rate between steps than other users and what could such a drop off rate indicate?\n\n**Sex**: For males and females, there is no difference in drop off between steps. This indicates gender may not play a role in whether a new user completes the shopping flow.\n\n**Device**: Mobile users have a 10% higher drop off rate between the search and payment pages (90% conversion on desktop versus 80% on mobile). They also have a 5% higher drop off rate between the payment and payment confirmation pages. These may indicate areas for mobile experience optimization.\n\n**Month**: A large increase in drop off between landing and search pages can be seen when comparing January/February to March/April. Drop off increases from about 40% to about 60% between the first two pages. Similarly, the drop off rate between search and payment pages increases 10% from around 82% to around 92%. This indicates a change occurred between February and March that is impacting the new user funnel conversion. The CEO should examine what changed from February to March. Perhaps a new feature introduced a bug or a new marketing method is recruiting more users who are less likely to purchase.",

We can see 40 of the 70 product customers have used the attendance feature. That is a larger percentage of customers. But we still need to see if the different user groups use the feature at the same frequency. \n\nIn this data set, we have the job dimension (elementary school teacher vs. middle school teachers). By dragging the job dimension onto the sheet, we can compare the usage of the feature in these two different demographics. We can see that 2/3 of elementary school teachers and 1/2 of middle school teachers are using the attendance feature. Now that we’ve identified this difference in the data, we can talk with customers and run experiments to determine why feature usage is different and ways to improve it.\n",

              "text": "## Comparing the Use of Multiple Features\n\nIn the example above, we analyzed the use of one feature, an attendance tracker, in reference to the total number of users of a product. Sometimes, product managers want to compare the use of *two or more features*. For example, in the exercise, you want to see if users use \"play a random song\" feature differently from the \"play a requested song\" feature.\n\nTo compare two features, you can follow the same process as outlined in the walkthrough and look at the number of feature users compared to the total number of product users. However, to better *compare* two feature usage, you can calculate the *relative percent of users who used a feature*.\n\n### Analyze features used only ONCE\n1. Place the events that correspond to a feature being used in Tableau\n2. Place of **COUNT** or **COUNT (distinct)** of users to see the number of unique users who used the feature. The two methods result in the same number since the feature can only be used once.\n3. Use a **Quick Table Calculation > Percent of Total** to see the relative number of uses of one feature compared to the other. \n\nFor example, if a product has 200 users, Feature A was used by 100 users and Feature B was used by 50 users, Feature A would represent 66% (100 out of 150) and Feature B would represent 33% (50 out of 150) of the *total number of users who used either features*. Note: the percentage is calculated against the *total number of users who used either feature (100+50)* not the total number of users who use the product (200). You can see that feature A is twice as popular as feature B.\n\n### Analyze features used MULTIPLE times\n\n1. Place the events that correspond to a feature being used in Tableau\n2. Place **COUNT (distinct)** of users to see the number of *unique users* who used the feature *at least* once. \n3. Use a **Quick Table Calculation > Percent of Total** to see the relative number of uses of the features. Note: since **COUNT** and **COUNT (distinct)** now results in different numbers, when to use COUNT and COUNT (distinct) depends on the question. See the examples below.\n\nFor example, if feature A was used by 50 users, feature B was used by 25 users, and feature A was used 100 times, feature B was used 300 times.\n\nIf using **COUNT**, we count *all uses of the feature*, including *multiple uses by the same person*. We will see feature A was used 100 times and feature B was used 300 times. Feature A would have gotten 25% (100/400) and Feature B would have gotten 75% (300/400) of the *total uses* of either feature. Feature B is *used* three times as often as feature A.\n\nHowever, same scenario but using **COUNT (distinct)**, it counts the *unique users* of each feature. We will see feature A was used by 50 users *at least once* and feature B was used by 25 users *at least once*. Feature A would represent 66% (50/75) and feature B would represent 33% (25/75) of the *total users who used either feature at least once*. You can see that feature A has twice more *users* compared to feature B.\n\nTo summarize, if you are interested in the *actual use* of different features, **COUNT** is a better choice. However, if you are interested in the *number of users* who uses different features, you should use **COUNT (distant)**.",

We know that the new feature of the music app was the ability for new users to play a random song, so all play_random_song event types likely represent a user making use of this new feature. In contrast, the \"play_requested_song\" represents the new user using the original feature set.\n\nTo see the number of users using each feature, one has to count the number of users associated with each event type. Since the users could use the features multiple times in one visit, so we will want to use **COUNT user ID (distinct)** to ensure we don't count the same user multiple times.\n\nBy counting the number of unique user IDs associated with the two event types in Tableau, we can see **1,709 users** played a random song and only **1,045 users** played a specific song during their visit.\n",

Explain your answer using numbers as evidence of these findings.\n\nSince we are interested in the *actual use of the two features* not the number of unique users. You should use **COUNT** when calculating the relative percentage of use.\n\nThe data provides three potential elements of demographic or behavioral distinction: **gender**, **device**, and **date**. By looking at the count of the \"requested\" and \"random\" events broken down into groups for each segment, we can calculate the percent of use by each user group. This allows us to determine if any type of user used one of the two features more often. \n\nAs seen in the tables below, both genders have about the same ratio (of all the times either feature was used, 67-69% times were the random feature and 30-32% were the requested feature). Similar ratios are seen among all devices types as well (of all the times either feature was used, about 67-68% were the random feature and 30-32% were the playing a requested song). When looking at the differences among feature usage by day, a similar pattern is seen. This implies that none of the behavioral and user characteristics tracked contributed to one of the features being more popular with a particular group. \n",

By adding segment analysis to funnel and feature analyses, product managers can further identify how different types of users use a product and can identify areas for improvement to better serve different segments of users.",
