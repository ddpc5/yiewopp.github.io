Decide what change you want to test. \n2. Decide which group of users will see the control and which group of users will see the test. \n3. Run the experiment. You want the experiment to run long enough that enough people can see it.\n4. Measure the results and see if the experiment results in KPI improvement. \n\n### Multivariate tests\nMultivariate tests follow the same steps of an A/B test in deciding what to test, making user groups, running an experiment, and measuring results. \n\nHowever, a multivariate test can test *more than one change* at once.\nThe multiple changes a product manager can test takes three main forms:\n\n- Test a range: any variable that goes from a low number to a higher one.\n- Test many, *totally different* versions of a feature or UI. \n- Test variations of a design by only *changing one element or a few elements* at a time.\n\nTo calculate how many tests one has, you need to *multiply the number of options in each testing element*. In the video, there are two testing elements and 3 options for each element (including the original version). So 3 options for the first testing element times 3 options for the second testing element (3*3), which gives 9 tests including the control (the original design).\n\n",

With a small number of users, it would take a long time to receive enough visitors to gain conclusive evidence on the best direction to take the page if they presented a multivariate test with many colors and images. Even though they could run a multivariate test in the sense of testing multiple variations of the page, the business should stick with an A/B test given the traffic the page in question receives.\n\n### Scenario 2:\nThe business should use a multivariate test on the design of the page. With a large number of new users landing on the page, the business has the traffic to come to a conclusion even when testing multiple options and variations. The business can use dynamic tools to adjust the number of pictures shown on the site to determine the number of pictures both across and down the page that result in the best click through. As a next step, they can also test different images in different spots to conclude which generates the most visitor interest.",

This means you need to instrument and collect information on the right type of users and ensure that they are part of the experiment.\n\nIt is vitally important to track *which test state a user is assigned.* This enables you to analyze the difference in results among experiment groups and to ensure the same test state is shown to the same user until the experiment is over.\n\nThe final thing to track during an experiment is the *conversion rate*. It is the percentage of users who successfully performed the desired action in each experiment group. The key to choosing the correct conversion rate is to choose one that relates to the important, long term impact you wish your experiment to drive. This may often be a product or feature KPI. \n\n",

That way, you can ensure the differences among experiment groups is caused by the change of the product, not by different user characteristics.\n\nFirst, you need to determine what type of user you are testing and make sure these target users are put into both the control and experiment groups.\n\nIn addition to everyone being a target user, you need to make sure other user characteristics such as age, race, income are balanced between the control and experiment groups.\n\nA great way to get a balance of user characteristics among the groups is to randomize who is in the control and who is in the experiment group.\n\nIf you are performing extensive multivariate testing, the best way is to invest in a framework that assigns users randomly to groups based on the conversion rates seen by each group to that point. Using an established framework or creating one based on strong data science principles can decrease the number of users required to perform the test.\n",

It would be most helpful if a user in one group sees either \"A\" or \"B\" no matter how or where they log in. They should also check to ensure the *user characteristics* remain relatively *balanced* between control and test groups. \n\nBy using random assignment, it is likely that devices, operating systems/browsers, and even user types (newer vs. established users; frequent vs. infrequent users) would be relatively similar across both groups. However, the business should confirm that these user characteristics are roughly similar across both groups to prevent unintentional bias.\n\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\nThe business should randomly place new visitors into control and test groups. They can help ensure the visitors are truly new by dropping a cookie on all visitors and only showing putting users into an experiment or control group if they do not yet have a visitor's cookie. As they are performing a multivariate test, the business may want to use a framework for multivariate testing that assigns users at different rates based on the impact seen of different designs. \n\nAs business A, if they randomly assign users, they should confirm that user characteristics that might impact the effect of the experiments are balanced among the control and experiment groups. For example, the business should ensure that each experiment has a balanced number of users on different devices/OS/browsers.  Since the business is testing designs with first-time users, they won't have much more information about the users to differentiate upon. If they randomly assign users, other user characteristics that might impact the effect of the experiments should balance out among the control and experiment groups.",

A T-test compares the means of two groups to see whether the difference in the means is large enough that it is probably not due to random chance. \n\nIn the case of an A/B or multivariate test, the T-test helps us understand whether any differences observed in the conversion rate are significant and are likely due to the change we made.\n\nTo properly evaluate the results, there are 3 steps that need to be taken *before using the T-test*.\n\n- **Step 1: state the null hypothesis.**\nThe null hypothesis represents the idea that the control state is not different from a test state, which is what we want to *reject*.\nA generic null hypothesis would be: customers *convert the same* with the test state compared to the control state. \n\n- **Step 2: state the alternative hypothesis.**\nThe alternative hypothesis is the one you want to *accept*. A generic alternative hypothesis would be: customers will *convert differently* with this change.\n\n- **Step 3: set a confidence threshold.** Product managers almost universally user a *95% confidence level*, which means a 95% chance that the result appears statistically valid and a 5% chance that the result is an error.\n\n> A higher confidence level means you won’t get as many *false positives* that declare your experiment likely has an effect when it doesn’t. However, a higher confidence level also means you may declare a test to have not had an effect when it actually does have a weak one. Setting a confidence interval before performing a test ensures that you are not tempted later to lower your confidence threshold to make your results statistically significant.\n\nOnce the hypothesis and confidence threshold for an experiment have been set, you can move to:\n- **Step 4: run the A/B or multivariate experiment.** \n- **Step 5: perform a T-test.**  After you get the result from your experiment, you need to perform a T-test to see if the differences you see in the experiment are significant. To perform a T-test, you will need to know:\n - The number of users in the control group and in each test group\n - The number of conversions in each group\n - The confidence threshold from step 3\n - Decide if the T-test is a one-tailed or two-tailed test. A two-tailed test means you assume the experiment conversion rate is different from the control, maybe *worse OR better*.\n\nTo see whether the results are significant, you need to compare if the *p-value* from the T-test is less than a threshold. Without going into too many details, if the confidence threshold you choose is 95%, and it is a two-tailed test, you need to compare the p-value against 0.025. When the p-value is *less* than 0.025, the null hypothesis of *experiment and control have the same conversion rate* can be rejected. In other words, the difference in the control and experiment conversion rates can be considered significant at 95% confidence. \n\n- **Step 6: take action.** If your experiment finds the change to be helpful and the results are statistically significant, you can expand the test condition to more or all of users. If the change doesn’t have the desired effect or the results aren’t significant, you should keep experimenting.\n",

We don't know if this difference is due to random chance so we need to use the T-test to see if the differences in conversion rate are larger enough (significant).\n- Step 1, the null hypothesis: there is *no difference* in the purchase rate between users in the control and test groups.

This is what we want to *accept.*\n- Step 3, confidence threshold: 95%\n- Step 4, A/B experiment has been done\n- Step 5, perform the T-test. Insert the data from the A/B experiment and set it to be a two-tailed test since the test group can convert *higher or lower* than the control group.\n\nFrom the T-test calculator, we see the p-value is, which is greater than 0.025. This means we cannot reject our null hypothesis that the test and control groups have the same rate of purchase. In other words, the purchase rate from the test group and the control group are not significantly different.\n\nIn this example, we see if the results of an A/B test were statistically significant by comparing the control “A” to the experiment “B”. For a multivariate test, you would compare the control “A” to experiments “B” and then “A” to “C”  and “A” to “D”and so on to see if any test states have a significant effect.\n",

For about half the users, a new design was shown but still had the same call to action, to subscribe to a newsletter.\n\nThe data that they provided contains information from the A/B test. In the data, you'll find a column with user IDs. The timestamp column represents when the user landed on the home page. You'll also find a \"page\" column that shows whether the user was shown the new, test page (\"new_page\") or the old, control page (\"old_page\"). The column \"converted\" shows whether a user subscribed to the newsletter (\"1\") or did not subscribe to the newsletter (\"0\").\n\n Analyze the data and answer the following questions.

There are **146,317 unique users** in the **test** group and **146,265 unique users** in the **control** group. If you got **147,239 users** remember that you need to count the number of unique users, not the number of times any person visited the new test landing or old control page.\n\n#### 2) Calculate the number of conversions in the test and control group\n\nBy counting the number of \"converted = 1\" when landing page = \"new_page\" or landing page = \"old_page\" , you will know the number of conversions (i.e. the number of times users subscribed to the newsletter) in the test and control groups. For the **test** group, there were **17,498 conversions**. For the **control group**, there were **17,739 conversions**.\n\n#### 3) Based on the the numbers produced in question 1 and 2, using a 2-sided T test and the statistical significance calculator of your choice, are the test results significant at a 95% confidence level? How do you know?\n\nUsing a two-sided T test at a 95% confidence interval finds the results of the test are not significant. We know the results are not significant because the **p-value** generated is **.9199** which is larger than the p-value of .025. The large p-value indicates that the difference in conversion between the control and test group is not significant at a 95% confidence level in a two-sided T test. An image of the p-value calculation from an online statistical significance calculator is included below for review.\n\n#### 4) Should the landing page be rolled out to all users? Why or why not?\n\nThe landing page should not necessarily be rolled out to all users as the results of the test are not significant. When results are not significant that means the test condition did not result in a statistically significant increase in conversions, which means any difference between the two landing pages is more likely due to random chance than to the differences between the two pages. This means the new test landing page cannot be said with confidence to lead more users to sign up for the newsletter. The website should continue to test different landing pages to see if they can generate a significant test result that shows higher conversion in the test condition.",

Usually the alternative hypothesis is that any differences observed are due to a real effect of the experiment.\n- **Control group:** The group of users in an experiment for whom the user experience is not changed. \n- **Conversion rate:** For an experiment, the conversion rate is the percentage of users who performed the desired action out of all users in a test group.\n- **Multivariate test:** An experiment to see the effects of a changes of multiple variables, including how the variables interact with each other.\n- **Null hypothesis:** Hypothesis in testing that there is no difference between test groups, and that any differences observed are due to error or random chance.\n- **P value:** The value that indicates the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. A smaller p-value means the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is stronger.\n- **Test/experiment group:** Group or groups of users for whom the user experience is changed in some way during an experiment.\n- **T-Test:** A type of statistical analysis that compares the means of two groups to see whether the difference in the means is large enough that it is probably not due to random chance.\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n- *Building a Culture of Experimentation*\nhttps://hbr.org/2020/03/productive-innovation\n\n- *How to Build an Experimentation Culture*\nhttps://taplytics.com/blog/how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture/\n\n- *Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing*\nhttps://experimentguide.com/ ",
