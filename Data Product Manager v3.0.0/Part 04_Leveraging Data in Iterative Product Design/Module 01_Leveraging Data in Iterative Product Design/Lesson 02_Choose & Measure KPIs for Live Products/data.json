A \"good\" engagement varies by product. Some products are used daily but others are used annually. \n- ** Adoption**: the number of *new users* who begin to use a product.\n- ** Retention**: how many customers *come back* to a product. \n- ** Task**: how *easy* a product is for customers to use.\n\n",

Some examples are Amazon’s online retail store and Target.com.\n\nCommon **KPIs** for the eCommerce business model include:\n- The profit margin made on sales (payment - cost)\n- The number purchases\n-  The number of repeat customers\n\n### Software as a service (SAAS)\n\nThe *software as a service (SAAS)* business model offers customers access to software for a period of time in exchange for payment. Users have access to the software for as long as they are paying for the service. Some examples are Microsoft word and Adobe photoshop.\n\nCommon **KPIs** for software as a service (SAAS) business model are:\n- The number of paying users\n- The subscribe renewal rate \n- The percent of users upgrade if the service includes a free trial and allow upgrades\n\nThe above KPIs track revenue and potential revenue *directly*. There are KPIs that do not measure revenue but they are *leading indicators* of product success. These are:\n- User satisfaction\n- The number of customer support tickets/complaints",

Some examples are Slack, a business communication tool, and Spotify, a music playing service.\n\nCommon **KPIs** for a freemium business model concentrate on those users who *pay* for the service:\n\n- The number of paying subscribers\n- The percent of free subscribers who choose to upgrade (conversion rate)\n- Renewal rate\n\nJust like a SAAS product, *leading indicators* are also important to track. These are:\n- Paid customer satisfaction\n- The number of paid customer support tickets/complaints\n\n## Summary\nThe eCommerce, SAAS, and freemium are the most common business models that modern product managers see. When choosing KPIs, it is important to consider how the product generates revenue based on its business model. \n\nThe KPIs can take two forms: \n- directly impacts revenue\n- leading indicators that help to predict revenue-related metrics\n",

Leading indicators help product managers predict whether a product's revenue is on the path to success.\n- **Software as a Service (SAAS):** Business model that offers customers access to software in exchange for payment.

Why?\n\nWhen finding similar business models, we must consider the way (and cadence) with which our customers produce revenue. In the case of an apartment complex, **users = renters**. They pay to get access to an apartment for a limited amount of time. The landlord still retains the valuable asset of the apartment building. In practice, this means the users in the business model of an apartment complex do not own what they purchase. Therefore, an e-commerce model does not fit apartment rentals. \n\nBecause users do not get the access to the apartment for free and pay for updates. The landlord business does not reflect the freemium business model.\n\nThe best-fit business model is likely SAAS/subscription-based. The renters are \"subscribing\" to the service of an apartment. The renters do not own the apartment but pay on a regular basis. At the end of their rental period/subscription term, they can choose to move to another apartment or to renew their subscription. ",

              "text": "### Question 3: If you could only choose 3, which KPIs *would* you choose to focus on as a landlord? Why?\n\n*Revenue is king*, whether an online media mogul or an apartment landlord. The top KPIs for a landlord would therefore most likely be **profit and revenue related**. A landlord must pay the mortgage and taxes on his building, so he must bring in enough revenue from rentals or lose money. Net profit (revenue minus all expenses) is calculable and directly measures the health of the business. Net profit should, therefore, be one of the KPIs you choose to focus on as a landlord.\n\nAfter profit, the top KPI choices for a landlord focus on those metrics that most reflect the apartment building's capacity to *continue* to make revenue. Revenue means acquiring or retaining renters, as every empty apartment is an opportunity loss. Given that it is less expensive to keep a renter than to have to acquire a new customer, **retention rate** (or conversely, churn rate) is likely a KPI that should be in the top 3 of your focus as a landlord.\n\nAdditional KPIs you might choose to focus on will likely measure the **customer fit/appeal** of your apartment building. For example, the time it takes to fill an apartment and/or the satisfaction rating of current tenants. Both of these metrics would be strong indicators of your *ability to continue to fill apartments*. If you see long gaps before an apartment can be filled, this might indicate the apartment complex/amenities/cost is not a good fit for the market. If satisfaction ratings of current tenants decrease, this may be a leading indicator that leases will not be renewed. ",

By looking at KPIs related to *customer’s journey*, product managers can learn where to improve and develop. \n\nThe customer's journey can be broken down into *Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, and Referral* categories. This set of metrics is called the **Pirate Metrics**.\n\n### Acquisition\nAcquisition is about acquiring *new visitors*. It is the first step in the Pirate Metrics because being aware of the existence of the product is the first step in a user's journey. \n\nKPIs around user acquisition focus on *how many and how often users can find your product.* Some examples are\n- The number of new visitors in a day\n- The number of new visitors coming from different sources\n\nIf KPIs in this category don't perform well, a product manager needs to do more work to help customers find the product.\n\n### Activation \nActivation is how quickly new visitors find the product valuable and decide to *become a customer*. It is the second step in the pirate metrics framework because new visitors become customers/users before they continue their journey.\n\nActivation KPIs focus on whether someone goes from being aware of your product to becoming a customer. This is also called **activation conversion**. Some example activation KPIs are:\n\n- The time users spend browsing the product on the first visit\n- The number of visitors who sign up for an account\n\nIf the activation KPIs aren’t performing well, a product manager needs to make the product more appealing or simplify the onboarding/signup process.\n",

She wants your help to determine if what she's spending on marketing is likely to generate the traffic she needs.

              "text": "### 1) Using the provided data, calculate the basic average customer acquisition cost per month.\n\n```text\nCAC = Total acquisition expense / Number of new customers acquired\n```\nTo calculate the basic CAC, sum all marketing and sales costs put towards acquiring users. Since the BestAppEver allows users access to some of the app's features for free, include the cost of all work done to maintain the free version of the app in this sum. Finally, divide the calculated number (total expense) by the number of new (not returning) users in a given month.\n \nThe calculations should range from a low of $91.27 CAC in November to a high of $150.45 in March.\n\n### 2) The app creator tells you they've been trying different marketing channels every month. Based on the provided data, is there a particular month's method you would suggest she invest in? Is there a particular month's method you suggest she not use again?\n\nThe month with the *lowest* customer acquisition costs would indicate the marketing methods that might be worthy of reuse. For this reason, you should recommend the marketing methods used in November (with the lowest CAC, of $91.27) be further explored. \n<br>Since many months had similarly low CACs, the app owner should also consider *if all marketing methods brought in the same type of customers*. For example, a month with a slightly higher CAC that resulted in higher spending, longer-retained app users might be worth the slightly higher expense. However, if all customers acquired across the months had similar usage and spending behavior, November's marketing methods would likely be the most cost-efficient marketing solution.\n\nThe month with the *highest* customer acquisition costs would indicate the marketing methods that might not be worthy of reuse. For this reason, you should recommend the marketing methods used in March (with the highest CAC, of $150.45) NOT be further explored. Given that the March CAC was *far higher* than other months, the marketing methods employed during that month are likely not as cost-effective as others.\n\n### 3) Using the provided data, calculate the lifetime value of an average paying user of the BestAppEver.\n\nTo calculate basic lifetime value for an *average customer*, we multiply the *average* customer spending (in a given time period) by the average customer lifespan (in the *same time units*). \n```text\nLTV = Average amount spent within a time period X Retention time period\n```\nMake sure that the spending and lifespan period use the *same time units*, such as weeks or months. In the case of the BestAppEver, the average customer lifespan is stated as 12 *weeks*, so LTV can be calculated by average customer spending in a *week* * 12 weeks. \n\nThe provided data gives a sample of 5 different user purchases over a week who we are told had a level of spending similar to an average customer. To get the *average amount spent per user within a week*, we *add up* the weekly spent by each user then divide it by the total number of users. This will result in a value of $23.30.\n\nOnce you have established the average spending per week per customer at $23.30, multiply that number by the average customer lifetime (12 weeks for the BestAppEver) to get a customer lifetime value. For the BestAppEver, the average lifetime value of a customer is $279.60.\n\n### 4) Given the LTV and CACs calculated, is the BestAppEver creator overspending on marketing when trying to acquire new users?\n\nSince the LTV of a customer doesn't take into account the expenses it took to recruit the customer, it is important CAC be (far) less than than the LTV of a customer. Right now, BestAppEver is spending about half of the LTV of the customer ($150 CAC vs. $279.60 LTV) to acquire new customers. This means they aren't losing money from their marketing efforts. Further data about the cost of app maintenance, the size of the addressable market, etc. would be needed to know if the BestAppEver has a solid business plan. However, you can confidently say their customer acquisition costs don't cost more than an average user will return in revenue.\n\n\n",

Before launching a new feature, you need to think about what data to collect at the feature-level and how to instrument the feature to collect the data.\n\n### Data collection \nWhile the Pirate Metrics framework can provide a holistic view of a product’s performance, it can also be leveraged to examine the success of a new feature. At the feature-level, data should be collected including:\n\n- Acquisition: who saw the feature\n- Activation: who used the feature\n- Retention: how often users returned and re-used the feature\n- Revenue: how much can be made from the feature\n\nBesides data from the Pirate Metric framework, it is also important to collect *customer data*. This data includes:\n\n- Which customer uses the feature and which don't. By tracking this, you can identify if the feature is used differently among different customers and you can know who to talk to to get user feedback after launch.\n- When a user uses the feature. This data helps you understand why a customer uses the feature and helps you build new features that meet users' needs.\n- How a user uses the feature (*event-level* data and *session-based* data) such as the user's operating system or other information that can change from session to session. This data tells you if the feature is used differently. It provides valuable insights into further improvement.",

There are two common *metrics* that you can calculate from the feature-level data.\n\n### The percent of feature users out of total product users\nThis percentage measures how many users *actually use* a feature after *seeing* it. It tells you how *widespread* the feature usage is among all of a product’s active users.\n\n### Feature usage frequency and duration\nThis data measures *how frequently* a user engages with the feature and on average, how much *time* customers spend on the feature during each session. It provides information about *how* the feature is being used.\n\nNote that whether the frequency and duration of feature usage are “good” or “bad” depends entirely on the context of the product and the feature.\n\nWhen the frequency and duration don’t match product expectations or the frequency & duration of similar features already launched in the product, this is a sign that further investigation and research is needed.\n\n## Feature instrumentation\nAfter knowing the data you want to collect at the feature-level, you need to instrument the feature to ensure it can be collected. There are a few best practices in feature instrumentation. \n\n1. Keep in mind the data you want to collect when making decisions on how to build a feature. Common data that should be collected: who, when, how the feature is used, and different events/actions.\n2. Test instrumentation before launch. You can simulate the data that will be collected and check if the data can answer every question you have in mind.\n3. Define and document any new events/data created. Describe exactly how a piece of data is triggered. Data isn’t helpful if you don’t know the meaning of it.\n4. Bottom line: Keep in mind your future self. Think about the data you want to collect in three months from now and start to plan and instrument it now.\n",

Customers pay per week for each food delivery and can skip a delivery at any time for no charge. You've convinced your CEO of the importance and power of referrals for attracting new customers. In the next week, your development team will be deploying a test of a **new feature** that allows current users to send a referral code to friends. If the friend joins the service, they get 50% off their first purchase (so that the first purchase simply covers the net cost of the food/packing/delivery to your company). At this time, the referrer gets no bonus. But in the future, to increase the incentive to refer friends, the company has a plan to experiment with offering a discount off the referrer's next order if the referred user signs up for a full-price delivery.\n\nAnswer the following questions with the above scenario in mind.",

In the case of a referral feature, you should ensure you can track the entire referral process:\n- which users send invites\n- how many users send invites\n- how many invites an individual user sends\n- if an invite results in a new customer\n- which users arrive via referral (this will allow you to calculate the the LTV of the new customers that arrive via referral vs. the LTV of traditionally acquired customers)\n\nNote: if different methods of referral are in the initial tests, make sure different methods of referral can be tracked separately. For example, you might give users a way to share on social media that generates a different code than if a referral is sent via email. This will allow you to compare the above data by method to see if one form of sharing is typically more impactful. \n\n### Question 2: Future Data Collection Needs\n\nWhen designing new features, it is important to instrument with the near-term evolution of the feature in mind. If you know incentives might be offered to the referrer in the future, you should ensure that each code and referral is associated with a particular user. More than that, even if the new feature is never launched, important KPIs such as how many users send invites or which users sent invites could be lost if the codes are universal.\n\nWhen instrumenting features, knowing exactly who has done what is crucial to measuring success. This also makes reaching out to users and non-users of the feature for feedback simpler, as you will know which users have used the feature. ",

You have just finished the second lesson of this course.\n\nIn this lesson, we first discussed the most common business models, including eCommerce, freemium, and software as a service. We learned that revenue-related KPI is a north star for all products and business models, and that leading indicators of revenue production, such as customer satisfaction are also important and should be tracked.\n\nIn the second part of this lesson, we discussed the KPIs around the customer journey. We learned about the framework of the Pirate Metrics, which suggests focusing on KPIs related to user acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue. By using all the data we collect to calculate KPIs at each step of the user journey, product managers can discern where they should be spending time and energy to improve a product.\n\nFinally, we learned about instrumenting features and collecting data at a feature-level. The AARR framework can also be leveraged to examine the success of a new feature. We should also track the customer-level data, that is, which customers used the feature, and how and when they used the feature.\n",
