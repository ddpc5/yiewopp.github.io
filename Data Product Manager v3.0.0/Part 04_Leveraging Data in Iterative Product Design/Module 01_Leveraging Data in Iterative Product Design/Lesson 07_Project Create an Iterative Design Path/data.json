The app has been something of a steep hit with the core group of flyers you launched with.\n\nYou've decided it's time to step up and layout a plan for how you're going to identify paths forward which give you the best chance at success. You pitch the team on an iterative design process that brings qualitative and quantitative techniques together in order to minimize industry-standard risk types so that you can move forward confidently.",

They launched three new landing pages, but they aren't sure if they saw a significant (and experimentally valid) lift in the rate of ride booking from this unofficial multivariate experiment. They came to you for your product management and data science expertise. To begin your iterative design program on the right foot and gain buy-in, you'll need the data collected during the multivariate testing and let your colleagues know if this experiment had any effect on the percent of users booking rides.\n\nOnce you've provided your recommendations, you need to run some *funnel and segment analyses* before you launch the next experiment to the site so your team has the best chance of success. Luckily, you helped build data instrumentation into each part of the Flyber app. You and the data scientists on your team have some *event logs* to dig through. You can analyze the Flyber intake funnel, compare trip booking rates among different demographic segments, and look for any areas to improve. You also have *qualitative interviews* from 20 typical riders to re-examine in light of the funnel data. Between the quantitative and qualitative data available, you're sure you can *hypothesize ways* to make the Flyber app even more successful!\n\nYou tell the CEO that you're going to summarize what's known and propose a path forward which is iterative and gives you the best chance of moving the needle. For the final part of this project, you'll create a *presentation* of your findings and present ideas for the next multivariate tests that Flyber should run.",
