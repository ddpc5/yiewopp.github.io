By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills to answer these questions and to leverage data in a more effective way. \n\nIn data-driven iterative design, data product managers evaluate user data to identify areas for improvement, then look for potential solutions, create prototypes, get feedback from customers, launch tests, and then return to data evaluation to look for more areas to improve and grow user satisfaction. By the end of this course, you will learn about the iterative design process and how to use both quantitative and qualitative data to help improve your products and better serve your customers.\n\n\n",

By analyzing user funnels, you’ll learn how to reveal potential opportunities for product improvement.\n- **Apply User Segment Analysis**: you will learn about segment analysis, including how to divide users into cohorts or segments that share similar characteristics and how to apply cohorts and segments to funnel and feature usage analysis. By looking at product data broken into user segments, you’ll be able to identify opportunities to engage and improve the user experience.\n- **Quantitative & Qualitative Data**: you will dive into qualitative and quantitative data, including the benefits and drawbacks, methods for collecting qualitative data, and ways to integrate data into the iterative design process.\n- **A/B & Multivariate Tests**: you will learn how to choose an appropriate test for different situations, how to track data during a test, and how to evaluate a test’s results for statistical significance.\n\n",

This includes\n**empathizing** users' needs by conducting research and **defining** users' problems by combining all research results.\n\nAfter the Understand stage comes the **Explore** stage, where different ideas are explored to meet users' needs. The first step in this stage is **ideation** when product managers and designers think broadly and generate a large list of potential ideas. Once many ideas have been generated, a few that seem like the best fit could be **prototyped**.\n\nThen the design thinking cycle enters the **Materialize** stage. The first step in this stage is **testing** the change. It includes getting feedback and running experiments on prototypes. After testing, the new design is **implemented** for all users. \n\nWith the new design launched, a product manager will continue to analyze data and reach out to customers to identify areas that could be improved. With this, the cycle begins again. By following this cycle, product managers leverage data to drive the creation of the most appealing product for users.\n\n",

In exchange, the marketing or sales team will provide feedback from real customers and great insight into the competitive landscape.\n- **Design**: Designers often help with creating simple prototypes for testing as well as leading usability testing on more finalized designs. \n- **Data science**: Data scientists run deep analyses to help data product managers understand how to better meet user needs.\n- **Engineering**: Engineers build and make changes to a product based on the direction of product management.

Product managers would completely plan out all details of a feature and document the specific feature needs.\n- In the late 1990s: Agile methods of design in the software industry began to develop.\n- 1993: Jeff Sutherland ran “Scrum” teams. Scrum emphasizes short periods of development followed by user feedback.\n- 2001: the Agile Manifesto published. The manifesto declared that better products resulted from, among other things, a focus on customer collaboration and a culture of product design that embraces change. \n- 2005: Stanford’s school of design began teaching “design thinking”\n- 2016: Harvard Business Review reported that the iterative design and the use of Agile processes have begun to expand into other business domains\n\n### Spiral development model\nThe spiral development model is a model of *developing software*. It emphasizes the importance of designing and launching small prototypes before developing and testing a final version of the software. The model uses a spiral instead of a cycle to emphasize that the level of commitment to any new design should begin small and grow over time as ideas are validated with data. \n\nTo begin, a software developer needs to **determine the objectives** for the upcoming project. Then the developer **identifies and resolves risks** in each small change. Different rings in this example represent different prototypes. Notice that the actual **development** including coding and testing doesn’t take place until the third time around the spiral development model. Every pass through the spiral ends with **planning for the next iteration**, which then returns to the beginning of the cycle where objective identification and further building continues.\n",

As a result, the waterfall process takes a long time to build a product, and because no data was sought during creation, finished products and features often failed to appeal to customers.\n\n### Agile Development Processes\nIn the 1990s, software developers developed a new method of Agile development. In contrast to the waterfall, this new method emphasizes short periods of development followed by user feedback. Features and products are iteratively designed in close connection with customers and potential users so that a finished product evolves naturally out of continuous collaboration. \n\nIn 2001, thought leaders on this new way of working published the Agile Manifesto. Agile development processes, including Scrum and design thinking, are now widely used across the software industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now, Flyber has been live for 6 months, which means you have lots of data to look at. You will use all the skills and information covered in the course to find areas for improvement.\n\nYou will first layout the KPIs that should define Flyber’s success before diving into qualitative and quantitative data on the Flyber flight-booking experience. You’ll also evaluate the results of a multivariate experiment and then, based on the available data, propose an experiment to test your own hypothesis for how to improve the app.\n",

You have just finished the first lesson of this course \n\nIn this lesson, we first learned about the *design-implement-evaluate* cycle of iterative design and the design thinking cycle of *empathize-define-ideate-prototype-test-implement*.\n\nThen, we covered many business stakeholders a data product manager needs to work with to find success in their role. \n\nIn the third part of the lesson, we learned about the history of iterative design, especially its roots in software development and the spiral development model. \n\nIn the last part of this lesson, we talked about the final project for the course. In the project, you will act as a data product manager to evaluate the performance of a live app and analyze its data to determine the best next step in a cycle of iterative design.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- *A History of the Creation of the Agile Manifesto*:\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/agile-manifesto-a-history/547715/\n- *Iterative Design in Interaction Design*:\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/iterative-design/\n- *Getting Started With Design Thinking (from the Stanford d.School)*:\nhttps://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking",
