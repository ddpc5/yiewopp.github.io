The shape of a funnel occurs because the number of users is reduced as customers “fall out”\n\nLastly, product managers look for **where large drop off** occurs. The steps where the large drop off occurs indicates areas that may be confusing or difficult for customers to make.\n\n## Traditional sales funnel\nA conversion funnel can be looked at in three stages. ** awareness, evaluation, and purchase.**  These funnels allow us to dig into detailed data about a customer’s step by step journey to find specific areas for improvement.\n\n### Awareness\nAwareness is when the user becomes aware of a need and/or a product. Users in the awareness stage *discover* the product based on their needs.\n\n### Evaluation \nEvaluation is when the user *researches* their options. Users in the evaluation stage take time to learn about their purchase options and consider whether a purchase is aligned with their interests.\n\n### Purchase \nPurchase is when the user *takes the desired action* such as becoming a paying customer. This is the final stage because, in this stage, the ultimate goal is met.\n\nUsers can take many steps in each stage. By looking at the number of users in each step, you can determine where the largest drop off occurs and decide where to investigate further.\n",

              "text": "## Summary\nTo calculate a funnel drop off rate using Tableau, we can follow 4 steps: \n1. **Review available data to look for the pieces of data that correspond to a user’s steps in the funnel**. For example, data showing a user visited a page at 1 pm might be a step in the awareness stage; data showing the user clicked on a button at 1:01 pm might be a step in the evaluation stage.\n\n2. **Determine users' steps and put them in the correct order, from the first action to the final goal**. Note that not all steps a user takes need to be included in a funnel. For example, some steps are optional and should not be included.\n\n3. **Count the number of unique sessions where users take each step.** A *session* is a period of time in which a user interacts with a product. If a user interacts with the product at different times, or on different days, each of these would be a unique session. The number of unique sessions might be calculated in the following ways\n - If every user could only interact with the feature one time (such as a feature that is only shown once to users, on the first login), count the user ID would be the same with count the unique sessions.\n - If a user could have had multiple sessions where they interacted with a feature (such as a feature that appears every time a user logs in or a feature can be used multiple times a day), you need to use count the *distinct session* not the user ID\n\n4. **Calculate the percent change (i.e. drop off) between steps**. This means evaluating the relative size of the number of users who moved from one step to another. In a funnel, as users drop out and the number of users that make it to each subsequent step gets smaller, the calculation will show a percent decrease between each step. By looking at those steps with a high percent change, you can identify areas that may need investigation and further improvement.",

There are two dimensions: ```user ID``` and ```Pages```. The name of the pages corresponds to a specific action taken by users.\n\n**Step 2. Put the steps in order from the first step to the final goal step**\n<br>After reviewing each dimension of the data, you can see that the name of the pages (home page, payment confirmation page, payment page, and search page) are the steps a user would take in a purchase funnel.\n<br>The correct order should be home page > search page > payment page > payment confirmation page\n\n**Step 3:  Count the unique sessions for each step**\n<br>By comparing the ```number of records``` for each page with the number of ```user ID```, you know each user only went through the funnel once since the numbers are identical. So ```number of records``` can be used for calculating the dropoff.\n\n - If every user could only interact with the feature one time, you can use anyone from COUNT user, COUNT (Distinct) user,  COUNT session, COUNT (Distinct) session and get the same result, as you will never double-count a user.\n - If a user could have had multiple sessions where they interacted with a feature, you should use COUNT (Distinct) session.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the percent change or dropoff rate between each step. **\n<br>To do this, we apply a table calculation for percent change. In Tableau, you can apply  **Quick table calculation > percent difference** to the numbers generated in step 3. In this example, the highest level of drop off occurs in the final step, between payment and payment confirmation, at 92%, which indicates the product manager probably needs to find ways to make payment easier.\n",

Under the \"**page**\" column, you will see four different pages: **home page, search page, payment page, and payment confirmation page**. These four pages align with an e-commerce sales funnel. Your website's visitors must land on a landing page (\"home page\") and then look for an item to purchase (\"search page\") before going to purchase the item (\"payment page\") and finally submitting their payment information (\"payment confirmation page\"). Make sure to order the pages in Tableau in the same order.\n\nTo see the drop off between pages, first count the number of distinct events on each page. Because this website has a simple flow, every page is required of the user to complete a purchase. Therefore, every page will be shown in the tunnel and every page represents a user taking a new action. To calculate the actual dropoff, use a Quick Table Calculation of percent change between counts. See image below. \n\n",

You might suggest to your CEO that you talk with users and investigate why this drop occurs. Perhaps the checkout page is difficult to use. Or perhaps there is another disincentive for customers to continue, such as a surprisingly high shipping fee.",

Then you create a visualization.\n\nThe simplest visualization is to **create a bar chart**. To create a bar chart, you can select that visual type from the visual section.\n\nBefore the visual can be put in front of others, you need to make sure all the **labels are readable and correct.** \n\nNext, you need to make sure the **title clearly represents what is being visualized**.\n\nWhile the bars show the relative drop at each step, it is always nice to **provide the exact numbers** for easy reference. To do this, you will go to the marks section and add labels\n\nFinally, before sharing a visual, it is helpful to **distinguish the steps with different colors**. This makes them stand out as separate moments in the user journey. To color the bars, you need to drag the dimension of interest over the color section in marks.\n",

Under the \"page\" column in the BuyStuff.com data set, you will see four different pages: home page, search page, payment page, and payment confirmation page. These four pages align with an e-commerce sales funnel. Your website's visitors must land on a landing page (\"home page\") and then look for an item to purchase (\"search page\") before going to purchase the item (\"payment page\") and finally submitting their payment information (\"payment confirmation page\"). *Make sure to order the pages in Tableau in the same order*.\n\nWhether calculating or visualizing, first count the number of distinct events on each page. Because this website has a simple flow, every page is required of the user to complete a purchase. Therefore, every page will be shown in the tunnel and every page represents a user taking new action. \n\nA **bar chart** is a clean and simple way to show drop-off between steps in a funnel.

You have just finished the third lesson of this course on evaluating user funnels to reveal opportunities for product improvement.\n\nIn this lesson, we first learned about how to create a user funnel. We examined the stages of the traditional sales funnel, from awareness to evaluation to purchase, and how to break down a user’s actions as steps towards a goal. Then we learned how these funnel analysis techniques could be applied to feature usage.\n\nIn the second part, we learned how to calculate funnel drop off in Tableau.
