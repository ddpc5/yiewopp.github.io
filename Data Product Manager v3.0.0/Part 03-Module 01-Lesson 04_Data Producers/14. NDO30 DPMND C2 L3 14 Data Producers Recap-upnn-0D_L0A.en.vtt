Wow, you are now three-quarters,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.430
75 percent, or most of the way through this course. Great job.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.305
In this lesson, we learned about data producers,

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:17.260
explored event data, and we did some event data modeling.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.610
Identified different types of data producers.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.775
Finally, we touch upon the concepts of structured,

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:26.955
semi-structured, and unstructured data.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:29.565
Are you ready to tackle the last hurdle?

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm so excited for you. See you soon.
