00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.665
production capacity, and the status of business commitments,

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:40.065
orders, purchase orders, and payroll.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:46.250
The applications that make up the system share data across various departments,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.120
manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.885
etc, and provide the data to ERP.

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:58.835

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:04.195
all business functions and manages connection to outside stakeholders.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.880

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.925
and PR does conferences and other events to maintain brand images.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:30.380
For all this they need funds.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.775
Imagine all these departments doing it in complete isolation,

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:37.310
it'll create all sorts of issues.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.205
They're better off having an ERP with specialized modules for their specific needs,

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.830
but managing resources centrally.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.780

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.665
