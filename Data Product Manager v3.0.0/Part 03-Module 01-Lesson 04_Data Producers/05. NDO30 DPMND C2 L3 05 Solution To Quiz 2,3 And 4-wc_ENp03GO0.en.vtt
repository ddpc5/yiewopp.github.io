00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
So let's look at Knapsack even data for the home screen of app.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.745
We have a hamburger menu on top-left,

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:13.545
a search bar, a 5-pic carousal of new products,

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.615
and a product of the day.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.560
Think about what all customers can do on the screen.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.785
Customer can click on the hamburger menu,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.335
customer can search in search bar,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:28.755
customer can click on new product pictures,

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.535
or customer can click on product or the day picture.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:39.280
Besides that, they will be able to open the app to come to the screen and close the app.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.730
Events that we can track on the screen could be: open_ app,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.370
hamburger_ click, search, new_product_click,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.450
product_of_the _day_click, and close_app.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.980
Once we know what event to be tracked,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.940
we will analyze the data collected around those events.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.205
We had 179 events in last one hour.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:11.670
Fifty-seven open_app events, 19 close_app events,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.395
47 search events, 22 hamburger_clicks,

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:22.620
30 new_product_clicks, and 4 product_of_ the_day_click.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.935
In last one hour,

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:30.835
125 unique user UUID were tracked for activity.

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:36.015
What this means, 125 users accessed app,

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:40.980
hence there were 125 active users in last one hour.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.035
Most popular and least popular is pretty simple.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:47.855
Forty-seven users use search,

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.750
so search is the most popular feature,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.045
whereas only 4 clicked on product of the day,

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:59.455
so product of the today is the least enticing feature for the customers.

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:02.360
To calculate daily active users,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.999
we need data for 24 hours,

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:10.385
or we need to note this is a two-sample of what data patterns might look like.

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:13.940
In that case, we can extrapolate this data.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.105
One-twenty-five users in one hour,

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.985
24 hours in a day,

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:25.355
daily active users will be 125 multiplied by 24.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.430
So that will be around 3,000.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.195
We have 3,000 daily active users.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:33.680
As a project manager,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.205
you will often run into scenarios where you might have to extrapolate data.

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.975
But to calculate session length,

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.015
you do need timestamps.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:49.310
Session length will be time spent by a user in one session on app.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.910
This data cannot be extrapolated.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.445
Data is simply incomplete.

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:58.260
Timestamps are required.
