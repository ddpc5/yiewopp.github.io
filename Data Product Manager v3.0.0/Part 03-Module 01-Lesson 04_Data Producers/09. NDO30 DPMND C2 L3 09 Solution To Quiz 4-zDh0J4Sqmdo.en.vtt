00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Types of data producers for Knapsack.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.300
This is what we know so far about Knapsack.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.800
So who are all of the Knapsack data producers.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.525
The data producers of Knapsack are: Website;

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.010
Knapsack.com, mobile app; Knapsack,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.770
our SaaS solutions; Simply Accounting, Just Sale,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.090
connected backpacks, storage devices,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.525
relational DB, Data Lake.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.945
Where is entity data coming from?

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:42.035
Our entity data producers will be the website and app.

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:46.985
All the transactions occurring on app and website will generate entity data.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:50.105
Customers registering and creating account,

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:56.760
customer buying backpacks, all this with create entity data. Our SaaS.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.610
Simply Accounting will have tables around all of the monthly financial transactions of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.775
Knapsack and Just Sale will have

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:09.155
data around marketing channels and associated campaigns running on them.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:14.560
This all will be entity data as well, stored in tables.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.400
Finally, our relational DB,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.545
that we use to store data around transactions,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.185
what was bought? By whom?

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:26.330
When? How much?

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.865
This information will also be stored as entity data in tables.

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:35.015
Our website and app will also generate event data.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.710
Users searching backpack, clicking through product pictures,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.665
navigating through various sections of pages,

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.250
all these will generate event data.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.055
Our smart backpacks are connected devices, or IoT devices.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.305
They will generate event data when our anti-theft device is triggered,

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:57.450
or while location tracking,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.795
or when emergency 911 is pressed.

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:04.665
There're transactions happening on Knapsack's platform,

00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:08.705
to manage these OLTP capabilities will be needed.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:13.415
We want all our financial transactions to be ACID-compliant.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:18.230
OLTP capabilities are must-have for any e-commerce business,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.340
all OLTP data will be stored in a relational DB.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.860
There is no right answer to this question.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.330
What is most likely to happen in the early phase of a startup,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.215
they might not have OLAP capabilities

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:37.655
because it is not necessary for basic functioning of a business.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:39.560
It is not a must-have,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.710
but it is good to have for a business to understand and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.355
analyze data to try to evaluate auto-fit.

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.785
So Knapsack is working towards this,

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:53.670
they do not have strong OLAP muscle as of now, but are building it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810
Our Simply Accounting is a type of ERP,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.455
it pulls in financial data and generates reports for its users,

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.825
and does automatic balance sheet entries.

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:12.319
Just Sale is our CRM that helps us keep track on how we are acquiring our customers,

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.095
which channels are most successful,

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:18.120
how our campaigns are doing.
