00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
As the term speaks for itself.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.600
A system, service, or user that

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.010
produces data relevant to business is called data producer.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.480
We need to learn in depth about data producers because data

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.190
produces determine what data is generated, in what format,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.605
at what rate, how much,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.635
all these factors influence our data strategy,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:30.530
and also what our data offering will look like to data customers.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.335
We need to go a little deeper into the topic of

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:37.640
even data to understand different types of data producer.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.170
But first, let's talk about how our data consumer can be a data producer.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.510
Consider a simple relational database.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.925
In our eraser example,

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.815
we had bunch of tables.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:56.500
Data is generated when customer registers or buys an eraser.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.420
That is stored in a relational database,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.490
let us call it EBD, eraser booking database.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:12.130
This database is the data consumer or data destination for all our data.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.820
But similar teams can run reports or query this DB to ask

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.440
questions like how many erasers were sold in certain time frame,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.295
and this DB will be a source of data for them.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:31.970
There can be many such instances where data consumer would also be a data producer.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.935
All SAS application will be data consumers and data producers.

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:42.230
We will learn more about several sub-systems in later part of this lesson.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.530
But first, even data and even data modeling.
