00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Data through APIs.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.330
Many online platforms and web services such as Google

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.740
and Facebook expose their data through a web API.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.415
Sometimes we need to build API connections and database connection to pull in this data.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:23.175
API examples, Facebook ads Insights API

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:29.310
could be feeding your CRM to get statistics of ads you're running on Facebook.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.830
Similarly, you might be using

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.160
Google Custom Search APIs to provide a customized search on your blog or site.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
Other type of data could be through flat files.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.020
No matter how much automation is put in place,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.235
there is always a need to ingest data from a flat files such as CSV.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:55.040
You need appropriate systems in place to import

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.435
such data and make it available for query and visualization.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:05.315
Data quality and data integrity is always a concern in such cases,

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:09.020
but you have to still figure out best ways to handle

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.020
such scenarios without degrading your quality commitments.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.785
Example of flat file data would be, transaction reconciliations.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:22.510
E-commerce platform such as Amazon,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.595
eBay, work with multiple vendors, small and big.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:29.010
They could be monthly or weekly

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.015
reconciliation processes running to reconcile inventory and transactions.

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:38.870
Many small businesses reconcile using CSV files.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.340
They send CSV files with all the transactions that invent to information.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.820
Organizations need to have capabilities to ingest and process such files.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.835
This brings us to the end of this section.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.100
I'll see you soon in the next section,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.870
with solution to all the quizzes.
