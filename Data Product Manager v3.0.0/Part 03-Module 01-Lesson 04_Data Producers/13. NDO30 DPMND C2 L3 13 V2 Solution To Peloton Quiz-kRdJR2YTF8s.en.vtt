00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
Let's talk about data producers and data.

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:09.945
Entity data. They definitely have website and app that will generate some entity data.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:14.460
They most likely will have some relational DB at the back end.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.175
They will have some SaaS solution,

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.605
could be for HR, supply management,

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.065
finance, accounting, or marketing.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.930
They might have Salesforce, Concur,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.100
Oracle, ServiceNow, so on and so forth.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.060
There are so many aspects of a business and multitude of

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.400
SaaS solutions out there, even data producers.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.340
Again, as we have understood very well,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.955
website and app will be generating some event data.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:47.740
The equipments will also be generating event data.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.815
They will be collecting data around consumption of their live classes,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.935
and also how touch screens are used.

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:59.000
They will have an OLTP for their transaction.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.230
They will also have OLAPs to analyze trends of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.925
sales month over month or year over year across different regions in the US.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:13.085
To manage their resources across different divisions such as sales,

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.760
marketing, supply chain, and operations,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.755
they will have some type of ERP.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:26.980
Reason why they are most likely to have an ERP is they are an exercise equipment company.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.870
They wouldn't or shouldn't spend resources in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.425
developing solution that are not unique to their space.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.870
They should focus on their core business,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.005
which is fitness and well-being.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.670
CRM. In today's world,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.295
where channels of advertising has grown,

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:45.725
it is hard to manage

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:50.980
all customer-related information across various touch points without a CRM.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.010
You will have a social media presence on various platforms,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.975
you might do e-mail campaigns,

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:59.945
you might run ads on fitness and well-being sites,

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:02.525
blogs, magazines, TV channel,

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:04.375
podcast or YouTube channels.

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.820
They are most likely to have CRM solution

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.945
to help them with their customer acquisition and retention targets.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.120
What type of data does it have?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.675
Short answer, all types.

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:19.325
To answer any of these question,

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:22.220
it'll be important to consider a few things.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.875
What is overall success rate?

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.685
What is the first attempt success rate?

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.790
Why both of them are important?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.115
We will discuss in next slide.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:37.365
Similarly, overall failure rate and first attempt failure rate.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:44.005
Also, what is the strategic implication of taking any of these decisions?

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:45.980
From the data provided,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.030
we can create tables and calculate success and failure rates.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.740
Hope you did calculate success rate and failure rate as I did.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.745
Let us look at this data for a moment.

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:03.140
Start, stop, and incline have same overall success rate,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.005
but incline has low first attempt success rate.

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.045
Stride length, program number,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.025
and my program have much lower success rates.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:19.960
Highest first attempt error rate is for program number,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.000
and highest overall failure rate is for stride length.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.350
Now let's answer our questions.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.695
Clearly, start and stop commands have better success rates,

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:39.320
and they also have lowest overall failure rate and first attempt failure rate.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.765
It will make sense to launch features that have minimum failure.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.050
If you look beyond numbers,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.155
this seems to be right set of an offering.

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:53.045
If we offered incline and stop in our first release,

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.705
it doesn't seem to be a cohesive set.

00:03:55.705 --> 00:04:00.950
Also imagine getting on an exercise equipment and you say start,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.680
and it greets you with a customized message.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.105
This might be a great start of your workout.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:09.515
Similarly, you say stop,

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:14.170
and it provides you with a summary with wonderful, encouraging message.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.495
This will hopefully make you get more on that equipment.

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:24.050
Resistance and incline both have same first attempt success rate,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.360
but overall success rate for incline is better.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.195
If you have to pick one out of these two,

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:35.120
incline is definitely the better choice.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.340
Highest error rate is in four word commands.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.310
This might be pointing out that at NLP models,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.905
natural language processing models,

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.910
are still not as robust as we would like them to be.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.635
I would like my engineering team to work on my program command first.

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:58.745
Not only it has comparatively higher success rate,

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:04.135
but also it will be a great offering with just one command,

00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:09.725
incline, resistance, and stride length are all set to your expectation.

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:12.940
Definitely a great customer experience.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.930
Sometimes you have to drill through.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.400
Even though stride length has high first attempt success rate,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.790
it has high overall failure rate.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.015
If we add all, our 90 percent customer give up after first attempt,

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:31.145
we should prioritize stride length,

00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:34.555
because it has higher first attempt success rate.

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:40.595
But if we are told only 50 percent gave up and rest try second and third time,

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:43.010
we should prioritize program number,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.580
because overall failure rate is lower for program number.
