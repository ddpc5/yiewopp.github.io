00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.245
Hello. So far we have learned how important data consumers are.

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:08.105
Equally important are data producer.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:12.000
What type of data is generated and how much data is generated

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
define several aspects of our data infrastructure.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.020
In this lesson, we will learn about data producers.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.280
Next we will explore event data,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.840
and we will do event data modeling.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.900
After that, we will look at different types of data producers.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.835
We will talk about data producers that are mostly hidden in the back of an organization,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.815
that manage operations and drive efficiency.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:43.745
Further, we will touch upon the concepts of structured,

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:49.110
semi-structured, and unstructured data with examples.
