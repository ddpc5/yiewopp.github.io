00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
What is event data modeling?

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.650
Converting event data to

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.470
logical aggregates using business logic is called event data modeling.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.505
Event data modeling helps us answer business question.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.625
We'll understand this with an example.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:19.395
For a mobile game,

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:24.855
we are tracking the following add events, ad_click and ad_close.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:30.720
We want to analyze add location data to influence our ad pricing strategy.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.595
Along with user action,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.800
we're also tracking event id,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.325
date, time, and ad location.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.770
Can you tell us which ad location is better source of revenue,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.730
looking at this data? I think no.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.210
Shall we put our event data modeling skills to use? Let's do that.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.740
After aggregating data across different dimensions,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.765
we get to this table.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:03.805
Here you can see full-screen ads have the best click-through rate of 52 percent,

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:08.805
and bottom ribbon ads have worse, 35 percent.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:11.745
Hence we can have tiered pricing for ads,

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.035
with full-screen being more expensive,

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.115
top ribbon location with middle tier pricing,

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:20.650
and bottom ribbon location having the lowest price.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.090
What we did here is event modeling.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.910
We aggregated event data using business logic to help us answer a business question.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.180
KPIs and event data, key performance indicators.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.330
A performance indicator is a type of performance measurement.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.230
KPIs evaluate the success of an organization

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.795
or of a particular activity in which it engages.

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:54.335
Event data helps us measure KPIs of a product.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:59.975
Let's look at few most popular KPIs project managers track.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:01.825
Active users.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:09.335
A user that is actively using your app or website is called an active user.

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:13.520
Websites generally track DAU,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.225
daily active users, WAU,

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:22.175
weekly active users, MAU, monthly active users.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:26.750
Project managers use this as a user growth KPI.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.290
They may define targets around daily,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.500
weekly, or monthly active users.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.425
Let's assume you have Spotify on your phone and you have not opened it for months,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.430
that means you are not an active user for those months.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.020
Other users who open and spend some time on it every day,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.265
they will be daily active users.

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:54.300
Next, session length.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.160
Amount of time a user spends on the app or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.990
website in one session is called session length.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.505
It measures how much user is engaged with the content.

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:09.180
Let's talk about Pinterest.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.460
If average session length has gone down over time,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.755
Pinterest will have to evaluate why this is happening?

00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:21.800
Is it because the quality of content has gone down

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.350
or is it because the UI or user experience is not as user friendly?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.555
Click-through rate. These days,

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:36.380
websites and apps have ads running on them as one of the revenue streams.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.770
The sites and the advertisers need to know how their ads are doing.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.155
One such performance measure is click-through rate.

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:49.945
How many uses clicked on the ad or on the banner?

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:54.110
This will measure how many users were interested in the content,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.890
or how many users found the content relevant.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.225
Google will track click-through rate for all ads that are running on its search website.

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:13.110
This will clearly tell them how many users are finding the content relevant. Bounce rate.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.675
Websites are built to attract users to either buy or to engage with the content.

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:27.300
Percentage of users leaving a website after viewing only one page is called bounce rate.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.785
It measures the effectiveness of entry page.

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:35.390
If users just leave from the landing page or homepage of the website,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.910
that indicates either we are not offering something that the user wants or

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.475
our content is bad quality or maybe our presentation of the content is bad.

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:51.715
If bounce rate of YouTube is high,

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:54.950
the whole purpose of the website gets defeated.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.560
Users are not uploading videos,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.120
watching videos, or engaging with the content.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.245
For a YouTube product manager,

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.345
this will be alarming.

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:12.325
Conversion rate. This is the most important KPI for any website or app.

00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:17.450
It is the percentage of users completing a desired action.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.200
What is a desired action?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.500
For an e-commerce website,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.595
desired action could be a customer clicking "Buy" or "Confirm purchase button".

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:33.925
For other sites, it could be completing a registration form,

00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:38.415
or downloading PDF, audio or video file.

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:43.525
Conversion rate measures users interests in the offering.

00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:47.545
A simple example would be subscribing to a blog.

00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:53.165
For a blogger, desired action is getting a loyal reader and measuring conversion

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:55.370
around that will be a good indicator of

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.365
the quality of their offering and the interest in it.

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.460
To sum it all,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.845
we know what event data is,

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:05.270
how to use it,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.050
and KPIs that can be tracked using event data.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.655
If you have noticed,

00:06:10.655 --> 00:06:13.625
you also know what event data producers are.

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:16.420
The event data producers are;

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.310
connected devices or IoT devices,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.145
websites or mobile apps, sensors and systems.

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:28.760
Last but not the least, social media platforms,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.655
and now you are an event data sorcerer;

00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:35.340
you can do an event data spell on anyone.
