00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
For this problem, first,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.160
we will have to think about knapsack data producers.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.315
We have site, app, connected device,

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:14.415
ERP, CRM, relational DB, and data lake.

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.790
We have structured data from site and app,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.885
we have structured event data from connected knapsacks,

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.775
a relational database, our ERP, and our CRM.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:34.620
Our site is communicating to our servers through JSONs and XML, that is semi-structured.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.835
We also have some semi-structured data stored in our data lakes.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.260
Our data scientists are working on a model to do

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.860
sentiment analysis on e-mails and by customers that are stored in data lakes.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.305
We have customer reviews for our products,

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:55.280
we have videos and images shared by customers.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
We also store or mentions of our product on

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.360
social media platform and blogs of lifestyle bloggers,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.285
that talk about our product or competed this product.

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:08.805
All this stored in our data lake.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:12.640
All these will also be unstructured data.
