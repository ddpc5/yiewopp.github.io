00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
We touched briefly upon what Event data is in the last lesson.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.230
We will discuss Event data in more detail here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
My so much emphasis on Event data, let's explore.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.390
In today's world of connected devices and social media,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.980
it is estimated 2.5 exabytes of data is produced every day.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.260
It's equal to 90 hours of HD video.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.595
A huge portion of this data is Event data.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.945
Understanding Event data is important as it will influence

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:41.925
how successfully we navigate the field of data product management.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.190
So what is event?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.270
Event is an interaction or an action at the particular moment by a user,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.795
a system or a sensor.

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:56.390
Examples could be an email that you open,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.430
or a link inside an email you click.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.545
What is Event data?

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:05.515
Data generated by such events is called event data.

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:11.050
Here is an example of what Event data might look like when you open an email,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.570
audio click inside your email.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.040
Should we explore a bit more?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.150
Common day Event data examples will be user interacting with the website.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.870
Let's say you download a movie from Netflix that will generate an Event,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.190
or you click on a YouTube video,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.170
that will be another Event.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.165
If you complete and submit a form on online fitness tracking site such as MyFitnessPal,

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.505
that will be also an event.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:45.445
Many other actions taken by users on a website generate events,

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:48.465
and these events generate Event data.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:54.890
This data is model and analyzed to understand how customer is using a website.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.075
On Reddit, you share posts or on Twitter, you share tweets.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:06.240
On YouTube, you like videos or on Facebook you like comments, pictures and status.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.260
On LinkedIn, you mention your colleagues or on WhatsApp you mention a friend.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.775
Or you use hashtag on Instagram or Pinterest to track and trend stories.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.685
Trends of such events are tied by all these social media platforms,

00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:26.690
and Event data generated by these is used to understand what is trending,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.880
what features are most popular and how customers are using them.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.565
From system's prospective, Event data is generated on several occasions.

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:38.800
Let us consider our server.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.280
It might trigger some actions like replication of data,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.225
syncing of data or deletion of a job.

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:49.285
All this is programmed,

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.735
automated, engineered and creates Event data.

00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:57.310
This Event data is analyzed by engineering teams to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.180
monitor if processes are running as expected.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.755
To check, there is no wastage of computing resources.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:08.905
Now, sensors all around us.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.410
Imagine a fully automated home,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.505
sensor that detect motion,

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.570
sensor that detect voice,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.565
sensor that detects smoke.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:19.455
If we talk about temperature set,

00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:22.895
a sensor generates an event when temperature is below

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:27.970
a certain level or above a certain level to trigger heating or cooling.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.205
This Event data might be interesting to understand

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:35.815
energy usage patterns or detect energy leakages.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:40.130
Now, that we understand what Event and Event data is,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.920
we will move on to Event data components.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.320
Event data component comprises of first, action.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.235
Action will be the download that user click or the post he/she shared on social media.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.225
Action will also be the motion detected by a sensor.

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:02.230
A data replication triggered by the server.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.480
It's important that the actual action that

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.035
triggered data generation is captured from event.

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:14.680
In an example, email open and email click are the actions.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.050
Next, timestamp is when the action happened.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.275
Depending on the use case,

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:25.820
granularity of time to be used for Event data is decided.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.215
For user action on website,

00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:30.735
seconds could be a good granularity.

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:35.820
Sensor used in satellite might need a granularity of nanoseconds.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.005
In our example, we have timestamps with the granularity of seconds.

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:48.260
State will refer to all other relevant data about this event,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.660
such as one device was used by customer mobile, tablet or computer.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.115
Which browser was used by customer?

00:04:57.115 --> 00:05:00.185
Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.795
As you can see in our example,

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:06.820
customer use iOS device and Safari browser.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.660
Now, that you are a champion of Event data,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.820
we should know how it can be used.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.630
For that, we will have to do Event data modeling. So why wait.
