00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.385
It is important to understand what type of data is generated by data producer.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:11.460
This influences our decisions around how it needs to be processed and stored.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.595
You are a pro at entity and even data now,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.925
let us explore another way of looking at data.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.310
We haven't learned what a structured,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.270
semi-structured, and unstructured data is.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.200
Structured data, as the name suggest,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.255
it has structure to it.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.735
Structured data is quantitative data,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.680
these are facts and numbers that can be collected,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.740
exported, stored, and organized to run analysis on,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.490
and follows a model designed by database engineer.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.765
Entity data stored in rows and columns in a table is a structured data.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:56.760
Entities are grouped together to form relations,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.200
due to this, it is easy to store, query, and analyze.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.515
Structured Query Language is often used to manage structured data.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:11.495
A good example will be transactions stored in that oil DB.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.715
Semi-structured data.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:16.220
It has some structure to it.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.744
Semi-structured data does not conform to relational databases such as Excel or SQL,

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:29.270
but has some level of organization like tags, consider HTML.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.405
It does not limit the amount of information in a document but has a hierarchy.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:40.330
With some processing, it can be stored in a relational database.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.245
NoSQL databases are used for semi-structured data.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:49.970
Few more examples of semi-structured data will be CSV,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.430
XML, and JSON format data from flat files or APIs.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.250
Unstructured data.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.865
It does not have any structure.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:06.410
Finally, unstructured data is qualitative data, example, customer reviews.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.065
What customers are saying is important,

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.965
but there is no easy way to run analytics on those comments.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:18.320
So unstructured data does not follow a model and cannot be stored in row,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.775
or column, or in relational format.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:26.885
Data lakes or NoSQL technologies are used to store such data.

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:34.230
Some examples of unstructured data will be audio, video, PDFs, etc.
