00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Data visualizations are effective in all three sections of

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.530
the proposal from the problem, justification, and solution.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.510
Here are some best practices for weaving data visualizations in your proposal.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.270
First and foremost, keep it simple.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.590
A number would honestly suffice if that's all you need to prove your point.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.110
Do include percentage change over

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.475
time if you're looking to highlight trending trajectory over time.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:31.350
Some examples include year-over-year or YoY, month-over-month,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.545
week-over-week, day-over-day,

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.050
and any other time period you're looking to compare against.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.680
Try to have visualization styling match the design language

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.255
of the company dependent on the time and resources you have.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.100
This may be fairly obvious,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.180
but visualizations should be visible from 100 percent zoom on presentation mode,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.680
and any unfamiliar abbreviations or definitions,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.495
like three-digit country codes,

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:58.990
should be expanded or clarified.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.310
You generally want to minimize text,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.515
and let the numbers speak for themselves with verbal contexts from you in the background.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:11.645
Preferably only have one visualization per slide and two at max.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.720
This right here is an example of something that's perfect for

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.845
a self-serve dashboard where end-users have time to explore each metric,

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.440
but not on the slide deck.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.030
Every visualization you show should carry a point and have a story to tell behind it.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.670
Five visualizations on one slide like

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.575
this example would be too interactive to drive each point across.

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.870
If you plan to share your slide deck with

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.690
your stakeholder's offline for their future reference,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.810
feel free to provide links to visualizations or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.075
the underlying SQL queries in the appendix for their deeper exploration.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:52.805
Do also point out any data caveats in any assumptions that you've made in your analyses.

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.500
Also do remember to allow some time for Q&amp;A at the end of your presentation.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.480
Next, let's jump into an exercise.
