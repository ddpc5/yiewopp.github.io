00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.450
The PMs oftentimes end up accumulating a really big backlog with

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.640
more requested features in customers

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.730
than their development team could actually physically work on.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.575
That's where they come into shine,

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.065
to make a determination on what the development team should focus their time on,

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.360
given the following criteria.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.040
What is the estimated impact that this feature will have on your users?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.070
Is development of this feature within the skill set of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.030
the current engineering team from a technical and resourcing perspective?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.600
Is this foundational platform work that will either reduce

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.065
tack debt to increase the development velocity of the engineering team,

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.200
or provide incremental building blocks,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.490
they'll paved the way for what we want to build in the future?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.655
Does this is feature align with the mission and vision of the company in your team?

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:55.060
Does it align with the OKRs and KPIs we have established for the current time period?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.545
Probably, development teams solve problems,

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.250
but at the end of the day, we still need cash to continue solving problems.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.080
So does it generate revenue,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.245
either directly or indirectly, and by how much?

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:07.955
Is the feature profitable?

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.055
Or eventually profitable through

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:14.975
eventual infrastructure scaling and or the volume of unit economics?

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.935
There's oftentimes so much conflicting data and signal on what to build.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.259
In everyone in the company has a unique,

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.385
but oftentimes, limited perspective of the situation at hand.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.800
PMs are in a unique position,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.070
being the central thread to a multitude of viewpoints.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.130
They need to convince stake holders from all departments on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.630
what we should all be building towards and the reasons why.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.300
A compelling presentation is one of the most powerful ways

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.130
to secure resources to create and build your product,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.395
in regards to engineers and designers,

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:50.750
to provide contacts so that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.610
stakeholders are aligned when they're collaborating with each other.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.100
Finally, to evangelize or manifest the user's story,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000
to build empathy across the company on the issues,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270
or pain that they are experiencing.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.740
To get you up to speed, in this lesson,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.530
we'll be going over the key points to hit in

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.410
a product proposal presentation and weaving

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.940
data visualizations and analysis seamlessly into your presentations.
