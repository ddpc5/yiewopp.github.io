For our lessons, we learned the role in history of product management,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.550
understanding the granularity, the distribution,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.325
and the modeling of the datasets that you work with,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:20.730
extracting product trends and insights through data visualization and enrichment,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.590
leveraging data to shape your product strategy through OKRs,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.860
and guiding tactical execution through experiment design.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.260

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.730
a product proposal that mobilizes teams towards launching your product.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.480
