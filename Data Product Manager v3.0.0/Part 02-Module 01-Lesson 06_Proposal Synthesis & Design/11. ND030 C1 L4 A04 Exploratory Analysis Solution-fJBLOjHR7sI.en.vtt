00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.540
To review the exercise prompt,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.395
you're the PM for an e-commerce eco-sustainable shoe store,

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:10.230
and we just finished A/B test experiment,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.020
where 50 percent of your users didn't

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.825
receive free shipping or the as-is experienced today,

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.900
and 50 percent of them did receive free shipping.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.165
Now your goal as PM was to determine and present whether or not we should

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:29.850
offer free shipping to all customers based on the experiment data that you received.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.305
Let's start out by first measuring if free shipping increases total revenue.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:39.075
We plot out the control and variable in a bar chart tagged against revenue,

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:41.000
and we see that variable wins out,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.965
meaning that free shipping, yes,

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.685
overall does increase total revenue.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.345
What is the average spend per customer?

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.140
Again, we could see that the variable group,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.710
the group that received free shipping tended to spend more.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.240
All things are looking good.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.425
But what percentage of visitors actually purchased something on the site?

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.010
As we can see here, the difference is marginal.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.855
We have a lot of traffic on the site,

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:12.410
but relatively few visitors actually purchase both of the control and variable buckets.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.090
So at the end of the day,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.905
does free shipping actually increasing income?

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:23.195
If we tally up revenue and minus that by COGS or cost of goods sold,

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:29.465
we actually notice that a control or no free shipping is more profitable in the long run.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.715
However, as an aside,

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.255
we noticed that free shipping does increase net income

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:38.915
for very particular products, these ones included.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.140
So this warrants a further investigation or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.330
further experimentation of only offering free shipping for these particular products.
