00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.755
Here's how I would go about weaving some data visualizations into our product proposal.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.575
We surveyed a random sample of professionals

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.380
that are interested in creating an online course,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
but haven't done so yet due to a handful of limitations.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.610
We found that around 85 percent of the professionals that we

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.150
surveyed don't have the software or skills to use video-editing software.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.645
We found that around 90 percent of the professionals

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:33.754
don't have the hardware needed to film course materials.

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:38.660
We found that around 80 percent of professional that we surveyed don't have access to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.610
a content management system to create

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.025
dynamic student interactions like quizzes or exercises.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:50.045
Finally, most of the professionals that we surveyed, around 95 percent,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.210
feel like they have a lack of knowledge on academic courses design,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.310
like grading rubric, curriculum,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.740
setting of learning objectives, and etc.
