00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.740
It may differ based on the culture of your product or company,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.350
but you should definitely lean towards creating

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.960
a slide deck when creating a product proposal,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.075
to supplement your pitch with analysis,

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.090
visualizations, and summarize key points.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.960
Generally, there should be three main sections in your deck.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.375
The problems are, what is the issue?

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.550
The justification as in,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.205
out of all issues, why should we work on this one?

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:31.110
Finally, the solutions are what are we going to do to solve this issue?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.370
In each section, you should have the following key points in your slide.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.415
Our problems and our pain points.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.560
What are the existing users in our pain points?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.890
Target users. Who are the users that you are targeting to service and build products for?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.140
For the justification, in regards to user impact,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.365
what is the potential impact of these proposed solutions to solve the user pain?

00:00:56.365 --> 00:01:01.835
How does the proposed solutions fit in with the existing solutions in the market?

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.120
How do you expect the proposed solutions to

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.185
shift or alter existing solutions in the market?

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.120
What is the potential impact of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.755
these proposed solutions to the bottom line of the business in terms of revenue,

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.385
user acquisition, and user attention?

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:21.790
The solution section will have your solutions,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.670
which is what are some of the proposed solutions we're

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.315
building to alleviate or solve the pain points that we called out?

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:32.890
This includes a high-level list of the features that you'll be building.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.770
Also, do be sure to call out what features

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.305
we will not be building as part of this iteration.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:43.000
You should call out the known risks and assumptions we are taking with

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.860
a proposed solution and what we should do to mitigate the risks or test the assumptions.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.660
So this key point may have limited information based on what stage of

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.485
product development you're in during your time of presentation.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:02:00.905
What is the roll-out strategy in regards to launching the service or product?

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.550
Will we have an Alpha,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.030
Beta, or an early access program?

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.900
In addition, what features are we planning to have in each one?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.745
From my experience, the ordering of your content

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:15.655
matters depending on which parties you're presenting to.

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.715
Generally, for executives and leadership teams,

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:20.245
start out with the problem,

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.465
then proceed directly to the solution,

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:24.995
and finish off with the justification.

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:27.179
For all other teams and stakeholders,

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.920
again, start with the problem, but this time,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.600
take a storytelling approach,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.670
dive into the justification next,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.510
and then lead into the solution.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.250
Now, let's jump into an example of how use section will

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.510
look if you're a PM in our hypothetical, company, Xpiliary.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.140
A company that makes customer service software for businesses large and small.
