00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.525
In user research interviews that you had,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.630
you heard that customer experience managers have frequently

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.105
lamented on the high onboarding costs it takes to train up new agents.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.625
A common product management technique is always asking why,

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:18.685
to get to the first principles of an issue at hand.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.960
After diving deeper into the data and research to ask why,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.030
most of the onboarding involves learning

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.065
deep nuances about the products that the companies are selling.

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.065
Onboarding costs are high due to

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:37.805
employee volume in addition to higher onboarding costs on an individual level.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:42.520
The average tenure of customer experience agents from which you found currently sets at

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.010
1.2 years compared to 2.3 years for the rest of the industry.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.045
Let us ask why again,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.520
only to find out that agents find

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.190
the work satisfying as they get to help their customers,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.950
but generally always face the brunt of issues

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.815
and limitations of other product from their customers.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:04.850
Agents are also closely monitored on their productivity on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.680
an hourly level and are judged by their productivity in ticket resolution.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.320
So our primary target users for solving

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.490
this pain point would be the customer experience agents,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.920
or indirect users would be the customer experienced managers.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.475
They are still equally impacted by higher agent churn,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.450
but ultimately the agent experience should be changed.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.565
How does solving these pain points impact users?

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:35.330
Well, these features will increase agents satisfaction and wellness,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.200
which then leads to increasing agent retention,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.900
which then as a result leads to decrease then total onboarding cost for the company.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.240
Furthermore, increasing the satisfaction of admins and agents with Expilliary,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.055
leading to higher product upsell and retention.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:56.510
In terms of market impact,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
this will help position Expilliary with

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.220
distinguishing features in the market compared to its competitors.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.785
It will drive NPS or net promoter score,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.335
which leads to higher customer referrals,

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.765
both from agents and the admins.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.685
In terms of business impact,

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:15.680
solving for this pain point aligns with

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.994
the Expilliary's vision of helping customers be loved by their customers.

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:24.000
This also aligns with this year's objective and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.580
key results of increasing upsell revenue by 41 percent.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.635
We're proposing two solutions to promote agent wellness and satisfaction.

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:37.280
The first is an automated positive feedback system.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.850
An example of this is where notifications would be delivered to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.555
Expilliary's UI to agents if CSAT rates are above 85 percent in the previous day.

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:51.815
Another solution is centered around the notion of agent kudos,

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:57.440
where agents could send other agents Kudo or statements of congratulations on

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.260
a bi-weekly basis for helping them out with

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.255
a difficult investigation or just giving them props on excellent ticket resolution.

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:09.720
This will help gamify efficient and accurate ticket resolution.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.250
So what are some potential pitfalls we need to remain cognizant of?

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.370
The customer experience managers may view this as hampering productivity.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.990
Prohibiting the enablement of this feature in their instance will need to win

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.629
their trust from other customer examples

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.020
and present this feature to them first and foremost.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.120
There also may be an onset of

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.695
repetition fatigue from a lack of diversity in notification prompts.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.810
We'll need to ensure we have a good amount of

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.445
notification styles circulating in the system.

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:45.405
How will we get this out to the market?

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:49.155
Initially, through an EAP or Early Access program,

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:54.170
to generate early adopters and customer success stories to further

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.340
evangelize from downstream customer experience managers in the mainstream market.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.170
Also we need to launch an experiment on

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.400
multiple positive feedback notifications across different variance.
