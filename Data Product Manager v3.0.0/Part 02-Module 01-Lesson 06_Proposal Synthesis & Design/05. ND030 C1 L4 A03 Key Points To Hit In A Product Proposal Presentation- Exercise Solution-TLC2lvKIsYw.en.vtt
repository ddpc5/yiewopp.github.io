00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.215
After speaking with professionals from different industries,

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:11.610
we found that many were excited around the idea of sharing their knowledge with others,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.550
and definitely do have the expertise to do so but

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.610
feel a little intimidated by the process as they're not

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.750
instructors by trade and don't really have the time and resources to get in

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.240
an environment setup where courses could be produced

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.645
efficiently and distributed out to students.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:31.425
Our target users are professionals that want to teach students,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.780
but have not taught in an academic setting

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.720
and/or are unfamiliar with digital content production.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.490
This would be impacting two sets of users in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.090
our two-sided marketplace, professionals and students.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.515
Professionals could leverage this as a means of extra income or more importantly,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.465
giving back their talents to the world.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:55.070
Students would now have a higher volume of content to learn from on the platform at

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.260
the same quality without being bound to geographical or financial limits.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.330
Having more employees of employers train students on a platform would

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.445
put more trust in that particular employer to hire students graduating from Utopia.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.295
This would not replace traditional academia,

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:18.800
but instead compliment it with real-world instruction from professionals in the industry.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.950
This would accelerate our recurring course revenue

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.295
with more courses in the door for students to choose from.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:30.545
What we propose is to build a learning management system for instructors to input,

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:35.305
publish, and manage their written and video content on their own.

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:40.205
Instructors may be limited in acquiring audio and video recording hardware.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.020
But no matter how good the editing,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.180
templating, and counter material is,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.720
if the audio and video content are not up to snuff,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.045
the rest of the course will be perceived as unprofessional.

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:51.515
To account for this,

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:56.030
we could explore setting up a service where instructors could select what equipment they

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.435
need and have an automated miller ship it out to them with instructions for setup.

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.625
Coding environments like Python, Java,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.990
or SQL workspaces may be required for programming instruction.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.584
However, given that this is an MBP,

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:16.880
it may be unfeasible from an engineering resourcing perspective to build it at this time.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.230
Hence, we could guide instructors to guide students to set criteria of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.559
success to measure the results of their programming exercises and projects.

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:31.430
Given that, our first handful of iterations may not fully capture everything

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.955
that is needed for instructors to self-serve content development on a course,

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.435
only to run experiments with a batch of

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.390
early adopter instructors who are willing to try out

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.330
a better product with a little bit more shakiness so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.070
that we get feedback on what's intuitive and what's not.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.350
Initially, course development on the product will be a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.694
little bit more rigid with very defined templates.

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:57.785
This will allow us to expand templating based on

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:01.520
continual instructor demand rather than working inversely,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.410
which is giving free reign for instructors to create content in any format they want,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.410
ultimately creating a less standardized content offering.
