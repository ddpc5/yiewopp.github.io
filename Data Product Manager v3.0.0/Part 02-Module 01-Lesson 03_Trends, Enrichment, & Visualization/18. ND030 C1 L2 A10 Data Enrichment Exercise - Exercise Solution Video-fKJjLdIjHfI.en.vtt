00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.870
After a quick Google search of state to region mapping,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.025
you stumble upon this dataset in Kaggle that contains exactly what you need,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:12.570
state to region mapping.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.359
So you download it, upload it to Tableau,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.860
and join it against the NFL survey data that you have ensuring that

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.740
the NFL State column is linked to these new datasets State code column.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.040
You peg the sum of fans that responded with

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.820
the political affiliation of independence as a row.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.510
Then peg the team dimension as a column.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.365
Finally, with the new dataset that you used to enrich this dataset with,

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:49.160
you can now filter by region to limit

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.960
this analysis to only those states in the Northeast.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.990
From this analysis, we've gleaned that we only want to focus

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.890
our campaigns for now for the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers.
