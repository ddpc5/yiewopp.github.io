Take your review measure as a row and cast it as an average.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.340
Filter on your data set by Product ID of three.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.190
Finally, take the country dimension as a column.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.550
To clean from this data set that the five countries with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
the highest average review ratings are China,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.275
Mexico, Russia, Brazil, and Estonia.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:42.490
To simplify the five point review scale into only three categories,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.709
remove country and take the review measure as a row and casts it to a counter values,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.340
inside histogram as the chart type.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:07.530
Change the bin size to 2.1.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.750
So that range is 1-2,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.930
3-4, and five are passed out into their separate bins.
