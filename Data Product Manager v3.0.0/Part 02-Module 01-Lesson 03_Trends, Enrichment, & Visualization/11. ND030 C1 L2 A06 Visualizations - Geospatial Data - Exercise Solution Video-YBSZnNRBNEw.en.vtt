00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.285
Peg your latitude measure as the row,

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.975
and peg your longitude measure as a column.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:14.500
Ensure that they're converted to dimensions.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:28.830
Zoom into your map. Turn on

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.780
neighborhood as a map layer.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.910
Play around with the intensity and opacity of the map until you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.200
are able to effectively see hot-spots without overpowering the neighborhood text.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.430
Zoom in a little closer to see more neighborhoods.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.470
From here, we can see Chinatown,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.239
lower east side, parts of Little Italy,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.519
Koreatown in the Garment District have the highest density of traffic collisions,

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.070
leading to the inference that we should be focusing

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.635
on placing our crosswalk signaling systems,

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.410
and select intersections of these neighborhoods.
