00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.645
Jumping off of the previous lesson.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.719
Imagine you're still a product manager at Spotify,

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.070
but this time focusing on expanding out their partner integrations.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.855
You're in the Business Development Team,

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:18.270
getting talks with Alaskan Airlines where you discuss the strategy and tactics of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.000
launching an in-flight entertainment experience on

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.750
their planes powered by streaming content from Spotify.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.135
The Alaskan Airlines Analytics team does let you know that their user base skews

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.325
a little towards Android users

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.845
gleaned by the market share of downloads from their mobile app.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:40.190
You then work with your Internal Data Science Team at Spotify to determine that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.645
Android users have had

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:46.145
historically slightly different taste profiles compared to iOS users.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:52.205
Rather than straight up data feeds or [inaudible] which is good for starting an analysis,

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.440
it's best to display these trends in

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.895
a visualization format that's easy for all stakeholders to understand.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:01.895
As a result of this hypothetical case study,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.800
you have presented to stakeholders

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.620
the different music trends on Android versus iOS so that

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.790
the Alaskan Airlines and Spotify partnership integration

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.600
plays music that caters slightly more to the Android user base.
