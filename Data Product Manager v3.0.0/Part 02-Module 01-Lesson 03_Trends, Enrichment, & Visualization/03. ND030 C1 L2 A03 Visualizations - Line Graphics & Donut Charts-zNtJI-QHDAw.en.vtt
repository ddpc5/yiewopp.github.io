00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.720
Line graphs are the most commonly used visualization for showing time series trends,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.105
or the measurement of something over time.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.435
The x-axis or the horizontal axis,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.760
is focused on a constant time interval,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.100
usually ascending from recency.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.860
In this case, it's the day of order.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.215
The y-axis or vertical axis plots the value of what is being measured.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:28.440
In this case, it's the number of total orders.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.350
When analyzing data via a line graphs,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.850
it's always good to split your analyses out by different dimensions if you're interested

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.770
in measuring differences in behavior

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.515
according to the different segments in your data set.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:44.435
For this example, we're visualizing total orders by month,

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:48.320
but this time, split against the different vendors in your data set.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.530
This enables us to see that the total orders for

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.310
vendor 2 is a little higher than vendor 1,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.250
but seems to be converging in the recent months.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.165
Pie charts are great for low cardinality analyses.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.100
As in against the dimension that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.525
compares only a small number of values against each other,

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.040
this time vendor 1 versus vendor 2.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.910
Pie charts are not ideal for high cardinality analyses,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.930
or against dimensions that have a high number of values.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.055
In this case, each day of the month.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:25.940
Some examples of low cardinality analyses that are suited for pie charts

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.605
are measuring the overall market share of a product between its competitors,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:36.080
or measuring the usage splits of a product between different regions like EMEA,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.420
APAC and Latin America.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.225
Doughnut charts function just like pie charts,

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:43.775
except well, shaped like a doughnut.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.910
Say you're the product manager for a grocery delivery app,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.970
and you are looking to build a feature that automatically promotes

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.975
churning items when they're discounted due to seasonality.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.615
To measure the viability of this feature,

00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:01.400
you will need to see if there's enough price fluctuation in the trending items.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.945
Let's focus on one item in particular, the avocado.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:08.610
We have a data set containing avocado sales.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.100
First, you'll need to take the average price measure and peg it as a row.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.090
We'll want to cast it to an average of averages instead of a sum of averages.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.175
This shows the average avocado price across all of time,

00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:31.015
but we all want to measure if the price changes over time.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.585
Take your date dimension,

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:36.370
and peg it as a column.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.805
From here, you can change the granularity of the date interval from year,

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:45.440
to quarter, to month,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.125
day or even any custom value.

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.855
Let's keep it at month.

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:54.845
You can break out the line graph into any other dimension like avocado type.

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:58.550
Simply place the dimension as a mark and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.970
ensure that you have selected on a continuous line as the chart type.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.280
From here, you can see the time series split of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.920
the average price of organic versus conventional avocados.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.310
To better visualize the comparison of the relative percentage of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.310
organic versus conventional avocados in terms of total sales,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.330
replace average price with total volume,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.820
remove the date and visualize this as a pie chart.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.840
We can now see that conventional avocados makes up roughly 95 percent of total sales.
