00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.620
Oftentimes as a PM,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.930
you will need to enrich your existing product data

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.915
with external datasets for greater context.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.535
For example, let's say you're the city's product manager for Uber,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.685
say we have ride-sharing data from Uber,

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.820
which already has the city of ride pickup.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.220
You'll need to access the census level information for cities to acquire

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.740
additional information such as city population and city population density.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.975
You have to find these sources externally.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:38.750
There are many sources online where you could find free quality datasets like Kaggle,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
Data.gov, FiveThirtyEight, or many,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.465
many more, links are posted below.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.805
Before joining your datasets,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.375
you will need to ensure that there is a common key for both tables.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.255
One of them usually being the primary key,

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.505
that you can link your datasets with.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.610
Let's jump into an example.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.385
If you have a table of ride sharing data with

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.230
city name information and if you find

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.345
a dataset online that contains city population information,

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:13.145
to join them, you will need to ensure that the city names match up accordingly.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.829
In this example, Wichita,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.585
from the table on the left,

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.585
does not cleanly match up with Wichita,

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.675
KS on the right.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:25.309
Some deeper data cleaning from yourself,

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.540
a data scientist, or data engineer would be required to solve this problem.
