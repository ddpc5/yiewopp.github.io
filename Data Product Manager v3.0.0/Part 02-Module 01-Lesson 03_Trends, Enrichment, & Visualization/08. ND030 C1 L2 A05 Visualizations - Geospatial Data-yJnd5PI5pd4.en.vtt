00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.400
Geospatial data analysis has been around for quite a while,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.510
but is becoming more prevalent and mainstream due to GIS or

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.480
Geospatial Information Systems being baked

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.350
directly into more traditional software like Postgres,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.719
Tableau, or Google BigQuery.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:23.490
Utilizing geospatial data is beneficial for product managers in terms of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.425
making decisions on where something should be built or launched in terms of location,

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:30.375
and how product adoption,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.475
especially for B2C products,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.100
spreads throughout regions, whether it's through

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.265
particular nodes or in a more centralized manner.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:42.160
So what do you even need to start analyzing geospatial data.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.150
At the fundamental level,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.190
you will need geospatial coordinates,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.545
also known as X or Y coordinates,

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.160
or the longitude and latitude.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.405
Here's what latitude and longitude looks like as coordinates.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.840
Precision matters depending on the type of analysis.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.329
The more decimal points you have in your coordinates,

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.705
the more targeted they will be.

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:07.880
Some common types of maps you may have to leverage as

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.375
a product manager to make decisions are density maps.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.450
Density maps, or also known as heat maps,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.620
show where the largest and smallest concentrations in activity are on a map.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.645
Density maps are colored according to a scale depending on value intensity.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.140
It's best to only have two colors and have white represents

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.325
smaller values to create a binary-intuitive visualization.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.130
To plot out a density map,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.760
first ensure that you have a set of points on your data set with X or Y coordinates,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.085
or latitude and longitude.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.799
Upload that data set into Tableau,

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.460
and plot out longitude as a dimension in the column.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.940
Likewise, plot out latitude as a dimension in a row.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.460
Now, ensure a symbol map is selected as

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.720
the visualization and that we're using density as the mark.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.980
You could format map styling through clicking on the map dropdown on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.755
your OS menu bar and style it accordingly to your preferences.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:18.300
You can also include map layers by clicking on map layers.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.220
From there, Tableau provides pre-loaded layers out of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.310
the box depending on what you need to analyze against,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.265
from postal codes, to neighborhoods,

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:32.290
cities, even physical road infrastructure.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.935
So by default, you are including the entire data set in your analysis.

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:44.330
But you could add as many filters as you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.225
need so that you can focus on geospatial patterns of different segments.

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:52.145
Here, we're adding Pickup Datetime as a filter,

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:58.980
filtering on hours and limiting our filter to only times during rush hour.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.130
Let's jump on to a hands-on exercise.
