00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.830
Box plots are good for quickly visualizing the spread of data.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.740
Its median, its first and third quartiles,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.490
as in data points in the 25th and 75th percentage,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.965
its outliers, and its total range.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:19.910
Here, the middle line in each box represents the median sales per segment.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.805
The edges of each box represent the first and third quartiles,

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:31.669
and the whiskers or lines sticking out of each box represent the max and min ranges.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.240
Histograms are good for visualizing distributions of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.485
continuous variables or variables that are sequential to one another in terms of value.

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:47.495
In this example, we plot out the passenger counts per lift ride on the x-axis,

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:51.485
each representing a histogram bin of one passenger count,

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:55.415
two passenger counts, three passenger counts, and so forth.

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:59.045
On the y-axis, we plot out how many rides

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:03.470
fell to each bin based on the count of passengers per ride.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
Bar charts may look similar to histograms,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.865
where instead good for visualizing comparisons of discrete variables.

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:17.750
Here, we plot out librarian employment on the y-axis per state,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.180
which is reflected on the x-axis.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.000
Bar charts are different from histograms where

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.075
the x-axis is not a bin or range of values,

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:30.130
nor is it ascending or descending in terms of value.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.690
Rewind the clock and say we're back in

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.530
2003 and you're the first product manager for a company that's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.320
starting up an online marketplace that pairs up

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.535
hosts with visitors for temporary homestays.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.810
You're pairing up with the executive team to gather existing market trends to convince

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.600
investors why they should provide your company with

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.490
an additional fundraise to finish out the development of your product.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.160
In this example, we have hotel booking data.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.460
To plot out total bookings split out by room type,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.250
which is a distinct data-continuous dimension,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.475
we'll plot it out in a bar chart.

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:10.630
Peg the rooms book measure as a row,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.610
and peg the reserved room type dimension as a column.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.130
Ensure that you have a bar chart selected,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.155
and here we could see that room type A,

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.790
room to the kitchens,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.000
is book the most frequently probably due to supply.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.090
Now, let's see how many days in advance users tend to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.095
book compared to their arrival date in intervals of five.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:43.030
As in, how many people book one through five days in advance compared to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.445
how many people book 6-10 days versus 11-15 days, and so forth.

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.100
We could do this best through a histogram.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.150
We remove all current dimensions and measures and peg the lead time measure as

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.540
a column and ensure that you have a histogram selected as your chart type.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.570
The bin size or how big each histogram bar is is set to a pre-assigned value at default.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.675
Well, we ought to change it to five.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:22.550
To do that, take the auto-created dimension representing

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.720
lead time bins and edit the size of each bin to five.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.100
From here, we can see that the lead time forms a long tail distribution to the right,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.925
terminating to about bookings 400 days in advance,

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:46.070
starting to flatline at bookings 100 days in advance with

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.970
a relatively higher peak for bookings 0-15 days in advance.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.780
Now, if we want to quickly track the distribution metrics like median, quartiles,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.820
and upper and lower bounds of the number of hotel bookings on a weekly basis,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.025
or want to leverage visualizing the data on a box plot,

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:10.020
take the booking counts measure and peg it as a row.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.640
Now, take the arrival date week number dimension,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.080
and place it as a mark.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.470
Be sure to select the box and whisker as the chart type.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.240
We could see here that the median sits around 2400,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.405
with the slightly longer tail heading to the left,

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:35.030
or lower values of booking counts,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.394
indicating more weeks of significantly lower bookings

00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:45.630
compared to a more contained or predictable range of weeks with higher bookings.
