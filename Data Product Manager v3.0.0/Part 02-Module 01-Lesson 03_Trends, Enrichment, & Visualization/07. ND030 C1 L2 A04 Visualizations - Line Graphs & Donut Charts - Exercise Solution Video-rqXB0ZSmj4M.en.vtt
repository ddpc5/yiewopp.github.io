00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.445
Take your room's book measure and take it as a row in Tableau.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:14.380
Now take the arrival date month dimension and take it as a column.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.250
This helps us visualize rooms booked by time, by arrival month.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
We can conclude here that the highest volume of bookings are

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.615
for stays in the spring in mid summer seasons.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:33.360
To measure the split of total bookings between the type of hotel on a donut chart,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.700
keep rooms booked as your measure,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.030
but remove arrival date and replace it with hotel as a dimension in a column.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.900
Cast the visualization as a donut to measure relative percentages. There you go.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.380
The dominating type of hotel where 75 percent of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.700
bookings go for your company or city hotels instead of resort hotels.
