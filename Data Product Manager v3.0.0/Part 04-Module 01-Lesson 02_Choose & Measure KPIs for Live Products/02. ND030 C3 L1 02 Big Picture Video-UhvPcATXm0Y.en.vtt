00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Choosing and managing metrics and key performance indicators for

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.270
live products is one of the most important responsibilities of a product manager.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.205
Before a product launches,

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.365
a product manager can examine market data,

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.975
look at companies in similar markets if data is available,

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.635
and gather feedback on prototypes.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:22.260
Once a product launches,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.020
however, the data floodgates open.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.570
With a live product,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.465
you can begin to see how customers use your product.

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:32.795
You can speak with customers and get direct feedback.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.310
You can see how metrics change when new marketing or features launch.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.380
With so much data available,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.550
product managers must choose the right metrics for their products to focus on.
