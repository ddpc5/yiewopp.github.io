00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
Let's look at how to calculate CAC and LTV

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:07.080
using a simple example company, The Good Company.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.720
The Good Company have 5000 users in June and 2000 of those customers were new.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.340
The marketing costs for June were $2000 and the cost to upgrade

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.545
and maintain the landing page and free trial of The Good Company product was $3000.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.395
To calculate the customer acquisition costs,

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.100
we would need to add up all expenses associated with acquiring

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.855
new customers and divide that total by the number of new customers achieved.

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:38.100
In June, The Good Company spent $2000 on marketing and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.185
$3000 on maintaining their free trial site, so $5000 total.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.800
They recruited 2000 new customers in that time.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.310
So the customer acquisition cost would be 5000 divided by 2000 or $2.50 a customer.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.695
To calculate the lifetime value that can be expected,

00:00:57.695 --> 00:00:59.840
let's look at the transactions and revenue

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.750
the company reported in the first half of the year.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.505
From January to May,

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.495
The Good Company had 3000 customers.

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:10.910
The average spending by a customer was $50 per

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.665
transaction and the average number of purchases was one per month.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:19.070
Finally, The Good Company knows that a customer uses

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.670
and pays for the product for about six months on average.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.390
To calculate LTV, we multiply average spending

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.070
per user in a month by the retention time period in months.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.380
We know that the average spending by users in one month can be

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.000
calculated by multiplying the average spending per transaction, $50,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.030
by the average number of transactions in a time period,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.695
1 for one month,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.725
then multiply by the average retention period,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:47.510
6 for six months.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.705
This calculation gives us a lifetime value for the average good company customer of $300.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:58.220
Any given customer might prove to have a higher or lower lifetime value,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.640
but the average customer will produce $300 in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.810
revenue for The Good Company during their product use lifetime.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.475
Revenue is the fourth step in the pirate metrics framework.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:13.925
Technically, this step might come before retention in some business models,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.944
but a business's revenue and profit can only be fully understood

00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:22.520
if the entire picture of the average customer journey is taken into account.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.485
So revenue comes near the end of the pirate metrics framework.

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:29.030
As I mentioned earlier, referral,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.280
the final step in the pirate metrics is important because referrals from customers can

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.070
create a powerful acquisition stream that helps

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.130
a product grow without need for additional marketing.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.860
Referral success is typically measured by

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.245
referral specific features such as invites sent from users to potential new users.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.680
When we cover instrumenting and collecting feature level data,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.730
you will have a chance to explore referral features as part of an exercise.
