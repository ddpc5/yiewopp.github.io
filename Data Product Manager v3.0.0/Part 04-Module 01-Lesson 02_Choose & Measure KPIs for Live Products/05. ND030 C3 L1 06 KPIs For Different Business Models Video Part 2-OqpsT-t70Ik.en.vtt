00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
The freemium business model allows users to

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.640
use the basic features of a software or service,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.385
but charges for upgrades to this service.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.860
For example, Slack, a business

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.535
communication tool that allows instant messaging between team mates,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.070
has a free model for teams while making its revenue from companies who

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.215
choose to upgrade for additional features like unlimited third party integrations.

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.395
Another example of the freemium model is Spotify,

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.090
a music playing service.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.720
Free Spotify users get the same abilities as paid users

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.520
to listen to unlimited music, make playlists, etc.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.869
Instead of offering additional features,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:41.750
paid Spotify subscribers get the benefit of not

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.160
needing to hear ads between the songs they're listening to.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.270
For a freemium business model,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.800
KPI should concentrate on those users who actually pay for the service.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.205
This means key metrics to track would be the number of paying subscribers.

00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:01.505
A closely related KPI would be tracking the conversion rate,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.110
which is the percent of free subscribers who choose to upgrade.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.670
While the freemium model supports free use,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.050
simply having many users is not as important as the number and percent of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.375
users who find the product valuable enough to pay for it.Just like a SaaS product,

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.060
the renewal rate of access to the paid version of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.285
the product will directly impact continued revenue.

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.020
Finally, a leading indicator that a user is likely to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.715
renew their paid use is whether customers are satisfied.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:34.580
The Product Manager for a freemium product must track paid customer

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.955
satisfaction.If the paid version of the product operates on a subscription model.

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:42.685
There are many different business models,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:44.350
but the eCommerce, SAAS,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.260
and freemium business models covered in this section are

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.900
three that modern Product Managers are likely to see.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.080
When choosing KPIs, it is important to consider how your product makes its revenue.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.975
Whenever possible, KPI should focus on how revenue is generated by a business model.

00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:04.550
The KPIs can take two forms.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.840
First, metrics that directly impact revenue,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.400
such as the number of purchases for

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.155
an eCommerce company or the renewal rate for a SAAS product.

00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:17.230
Second, KPIs that act as leading indicators about whether

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.950
revenue related metrics like purchases and renewal rates are going to go up or down.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.320
Customer satisfaction rates and the number of customer support tickets are two such KPIs.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.675
Product Managers have access to a lot of data,

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:36.065
but by keeping in mind the business model of your company,

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.230
you can determine the best fit KPIs to track.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.009
To ensure your products and features are on the path to success.
