00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Google researchers created a framework called the HEART,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.194
H-E-R-T model to help you think about the different types of metrics available.

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:13.050
The HEART model simplifies the vast amounts of data you might have

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.580
available by reminding you to find categories into which individual pieces of data fit.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.715
This is a great way to develop your intuition about metrics.

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:24.170
In the HEART model,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.560
product data is considered in five categories.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.055
The H stands for happiness.

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:34.970
That is, how happy or satisfied is the customer with your product or feature?

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.490
Some examples of data you might analyze in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.640
this category would be your customer's app store rating,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.390
or how easy customers say they find your product to use.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.530
The E in the HEART model stands for engagement of the level and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.730
frequency with which users interact with your product and features.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.260
What makes engagement good will vary by product.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.500
For example, into its highly successful TurboTax software

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.785
is used by most customers only during tax season.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:08.960
But this level of engagement makes sense for a product whose main use case is annual.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.570
A different example might be a mobile game

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.240
where daily check-ins and usage could be the norm.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.900
The important takeaway is that when you think about metrics,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.605
how often a customer uses a product or feature is an important category of data.

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:26.890
In the HEART model, the A stands for adoption,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.530
or the number of new users who begin to use a product.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.470
Examples of adoption might be the number of

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.945
sales or the number of users who utilize a new feature.

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:41.419
The R in the HEART model stands for retention.

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:47.125
Much important data measures how often customers and users come back to your product.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.390
Churn rate and number of repeat visitors are

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.250
examples of metrics you might consider in the retention category.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.620
The final T in the HEART model stands for task success.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.950
Does the design of your product allow users to quickly and efficiently navigate?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.305
Many UX metrics will fall into this data category.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:10.295
As you work on a product,

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.865
you will develop your own categories and definitions.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:18.120
But using the HEART model is a great place to start.
