00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
In this exercise, you're asked to instrument

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.190
a new referral feature for the food fast meal delivery service.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.245
Question 1 asks which data you need to track

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:13.425
in order to know whether the new feature is successful.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.105
By using pirate metrics,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:20.445
we can identify the questions we will want to answer about the steps in the user journey.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.125
When the feature launches,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.855
if we're tracking the metrics that answer these questions,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.510
we can quickly determine the relative success of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.540
the feature and places we might want to improve.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.390
First for acquisition, we'll want to see

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.585
how many in which users see the referral feature.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.850
Tracking these metrics might tell us if

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.015
the referral feature is visible enough to current users.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.425
Next, we should consider activation metrics,

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.720
such as how many and which users send

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.700
invites and how many and which users arrive via referral.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.560
This will show us if the referral feature is appealing

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.680
enough to current users and the referred users.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.235
After activation, we will want to consider retention.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:03.920
How many users are sending multiple invites?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.940
How many invites is an average user sending?

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.690
For the referred users,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.460
how many are retained pass their first discounted delivery and become paying customers?

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.460
This will tell us the strength of the referral program and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.670
its likelihood to result in continued referrals.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.495
Finally, under revenue, we will want to know how many and which

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:27.605
invites ended up turning a referred user into a new customer.

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.890
Question 2, assess whether to recommend launching with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.115
a single code or with codes unique to each user.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:38.090
Even though it might be much simpler and take less development time to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.140
launch a single code that could be used universally by all refers,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.705
the service would lose a lot of valuable data following this route.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.100
In discussing questions, we need to track metrics on to answer.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.555
We've repeatedly noted the need to track which users take certain actions.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.595
Such tracking can only be done with codes unique to each user.

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:00.755
It isn't enough to simply track the average user.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:06.350
Later on, we will likely want to dig into the type of customers who refer and the type of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.140
referred user that becomes a customer to see if

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.400
the feature can be better tailored for these high-impact cases.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.530
We'll also likely want to follow up with users

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.070
and non-users of the referral feature to gather feedback.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.855
When designing new features,

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:25.030
it is important to instrument with a near term evolution of the feature in mind.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.700
If you know incentives might be offered to the refer in the future,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.630
you probably should use unique codes right now.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.650
Thus, launching with a single code should not be suggested when instrumenting features.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.329
Knowing exactly who has done what is crucial to being able to measure success.
