00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
For this exercise, you are asked to think like a landlord of a small apartment complex.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.775
What business model does a landlord most resemble?

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.625
What KPIs could a landlord track?

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.980
What are the North Star KPIs,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.925
that should lead a landlords evaluation of his business performance?

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.805
Let's dive in. Question one.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:26.190
Which business model discussed in this section seems most similar to renting apartments?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.865
Why? Remember that a business model relates to how and why a business makes revenue.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:38.610
Let's compare the situation of a landlord to the three business models we discussed.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.250
First, the E-commerce model.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.405
Is the landlord getting paid once for a product that the customer then keeps forever?

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:50.494
Maybe if the landlord was a real estate agent selling apartments,

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:56.015
but no, his customers are renters who repeatedly pay for access to an apartment.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:59.290
So e-commerce is not the closest business model.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.635
Next, the Freemium model.

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:03.980
Do landlords allows some renters to

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.250
access the apartment for free and only pay for upgrades?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.705
No, not really.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.255
So that is not the most similar.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:15.850
Finally, the SAAS, or software as a service and subscription models.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.935
Users purchase temporary access to a software.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:22.925
In the case of an apartment complex, users is renters.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:27.100
They pay to get access to an apartment for a limited amount of time.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.965
The renters are subscribing to the service of an apartment.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.065
The renters do not own the apartment,

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.200
but pay on a regular basis.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.525
At the end of their rental period or subscription term,

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:42.890
they can choose to move to another apartment or to renew their subscription.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.685
So the SAAS model is the closest fit,

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:48.305
even though in this case it is living space,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.405
not software as a service.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.805
Now let's consider a question two.

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.230
What KPIs could you measure as a landlord?

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.080
As a landlord, different categories of KPIs can be measured.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.330
Even landlords need to decide what to focus on.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.720
For this question, you were asked to think of

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.610
a few example KPIs for different categories of concern.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.620
The first category was finding new tenants,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.980
which is similar to acquiring new customers.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.995
An example KPI in this category is time between rentals.

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.330
When an apartment isn't being rented,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.460
a landlord isn't making money.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.505
So how fast they can acquire new customers might be an important KPI.

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:34.310
Remember, your solution might have had different KPIs,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.840
but as long as they were measurable and related to the category,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.975
you identified potential KPIs for a landlord.

00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:44.000
The second category was renter happiness,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.625
which is similar to customer satisfaction.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:51.890
An example of this is renter happiness with their apartment complex and maintenance,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.625
which the landlord could measure via a survey.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.575
The third category was repairs and maintenance,

00:02:57.575 --> 00:02:59.375
similar to customer support.

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:02.795
An example of this is a number of work orders

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:06.715
which might be similar to the number of customer support tickets received.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:10.175
The final category was around Revenues and Costs.

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.320
Some examples of this would be,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.995
revenue per month from rental fees and net profit revenue after all costs and expenses.

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:23.765
From question two, we know that landlords like data product managers,

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.660
face a lot of data and potential KPIs,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.800
but which to focus on?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.880
Question three asks, if you could only choose three,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.200
which KPIs would you choose to focus on as a landlord and why?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.920
Well, the first focus of a landlord or a business is the revenue coming in the door.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.165
So when looking at the data available,

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.690
the most valuable is going to be KPIs that either are

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.470
revenue or directly impact revenue and potential revenue.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.850
For this reason, you should first focus on revenue or net profit.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.000
Then you should choose KPIs that show whether

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.930
that revenue will continue and customers will continue to buy.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.600
As we saw when looking at business models,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.740
customer satisfaction is a leading indicator to show if the product we're

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.450
offering is a good fit and people are likely to continue to pay for our product.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.335
So the second KPI would be renters satisfaction,

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:23.090
which is a leading indicator of whether our renter customers will renew,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.690
and a third KPI to focus on would be renewal rates,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.620
the actual rate at which our renter customers choose to repurchase.
