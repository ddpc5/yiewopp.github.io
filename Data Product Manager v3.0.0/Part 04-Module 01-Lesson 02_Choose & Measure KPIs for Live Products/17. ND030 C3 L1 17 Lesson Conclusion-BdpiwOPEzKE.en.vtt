00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Congratulations.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.025
You have just finished the second lesson of this course.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.935
Now let's summarize what we have learned.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.890
In this lesson, we first discussed how revenue is

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.100
generated in some of today's most common business models,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.330
including eCommerce, freemium, and Software as a Service.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.300
We learned that revenue-related KPI's are

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.120
a North Star for all products and business models.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.650
We also learned that while different business models generate revenue in different ways,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.260
important KPIs for all product managers

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.350
center on leading indicators of revenue production,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.460
such as customer satisfaction.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.420
In the second part of this lesson,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.340
we discussed the importance of looking at

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.070
our data from the perspective of the customer journey.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.740
We learned about the framework of pirate metrics,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.930
which suggests focusing our attention on KPIs related to user acquisition,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.240
activation, retention, and revenue.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.495
By using all the data we collect to calculate KPIs at each step in the user journey,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.850
product managers can discern where they should be

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.780
spending time and energy to improve a product.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.400
Finally, in the third part of this lesson,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.904
we learned about instrumenting new features.

00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:14.795
While the AARRR framework can provide a holistic view of a product's performance,

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.530
it can also be leveraged to examine the success of a new feature.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.110
We should also track the customer level data.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.865
That is, which customers use the feature and how and when they use the feature.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.919
In order to use such KPIs,

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:30.805
however, every new feature must be instrumented.

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:35.720
We also learned the importance of data product managers adding additional tracking to

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.730
ensure KPIs can be evaluated at

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.260
the feature level in addition to the overall product view.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.070
Congratulations on completing this lesson.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.420
In the next lesson, we will look at analyzing user funnels and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.720
feature use to optimize performance. See you soon.
