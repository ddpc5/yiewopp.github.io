00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.229
The first R in pirate metrics stands for retention.

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.480
Retention ask the question,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.635
do users come back?

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:15.405
Retention KPIs focus on a number of users to return and continue using your product.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:21.105
Are most users returning and renewing their subscriptions or making multiple purchases?

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.420
Or are you seeing a large amount of churn?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.470
Some example retention KPIs might be the number of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.240
customers who renew their subscriptions or who come back and make multiple purchases.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.785
Another retention KPI is the average length of time a user remains a customer.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:43.130
For example, some products might get a lot of customers right away.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.090
But if those customers drop off and stop using the product after a week,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.215
the average customer life span will be very short.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:53.755
Watching and monitoring user retention KPIs,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:56.600
will help you know if your time should be focused on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.580
building features to ensure your product is providing real value to customers.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.470
If your KPIs in this category aren't performing well as a product manager,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.720
you'll know you need to do more work to help

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.290
customers want to continue using or purchasing from you,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.280
probably by providing features that meet your customer's needs.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.240
Retention is the third step in the pirate metrics framework.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.025
If you're acquiring lots of potential users and converting them into active users,

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:27.155
your products still won't be successful.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:31.445
If you don't retain these active users and keep them using your product,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.324
it is often expensive to find new customers

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:37.370
and there are limited number of potential customers.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.935
Successful products retain users for as long as possible.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.840
As we learned in the first section of this lesson,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.205
at the end of the day,

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.095
businesses need to make money.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:52.345
Thus, the pirate metrics include revenue as one of its steps.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.420
Defining revenue is simple.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.185
Revenue is the amount a product makes.

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.425
Revenue tells us how much money a business is generating.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.825
Profit, which is closely related,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.965
is the revenue generated minus the costs associated with marketing,

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.260
creating, and maintaining the product.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.390
When thinking about the user journey,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.230
there are two more KPIs that will be important to keep in mind.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.585
First, the cost to acquire a new customer, or CAC.

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:23.120
This is how much you spend in marketing and creating websites or

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.790
demos for potential users who eventually become paying customers.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.690
The lower this cost is,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.600
the higher the profit calculation at the end of the day.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.520
By working to lower these costs,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.145
you can directly impact the bottom line.

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:42.080
Another revenue KPI, is the customer lifetime value or LTV.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.075
This is the amount of revenue and average customer generates.

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.355
The higher the lifetime value of an average customer,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.845
the greater the revenue that is generated with

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:55.175
each new customer acquired, activated, and retained.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.470
By comparing CAC to LTV,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.840
we can see whether we're spending more to gain

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.920
customers than those customers are worth thus.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.210
If LTV is less than CAC,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.205
our product is not profitable,

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:11.855
especially since CAC doesn't take into account the general costs of running a company.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.495
Since CAC and LTV are so important,

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:18.600
we'll discuss exactly how to calculate them next.
