00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
KPIs or key performance indicators,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:05.370
are the metrics that you selected as

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.265
the most important metrics to track for your company.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.255
At the end of the day, we want to build products that turn a profit.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.970
This means that the KPIs you focus on as

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.430
a Data Product Manager should either directly or indirectly be linked to revenue.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
Though all Product Managers share a need for such KPIs,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
the way products make money varies depending on the business model.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.225
This means the most common KPIs for a product also vary by business model.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.665
In this section, we'll discuss three common business models,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:44.020
eCommerce, freemium, and Software as a Service, or SaaS.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.200
For each model, we'll learn how the business model is defined.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.865
Then we'll discuss KPIs that best match these different models,

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:56.920
especially those KPIs most closely tied to revenue.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.180
The eCommerce business model is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.185
a traditional model of the sale of an item in exchange for payment.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:08.900
Customers may buy one item from the business or may return and make many purchases.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.360
Ecommerce is simply a brick and mortar business model with a storefront as online.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.705
An example of traditional eCommerce business models is Amazon's online retail store.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:26.210
Amazon is a large company and also makes money from other services and partnerships.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.375
However, it's original business model consists

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.900
of selling items online to Amazon customers.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.595
Unlike Amazon, Target has a large physical presence.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.460
Its sales on target.com,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.825
however provide an example of the eCommerce model.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:45.140
A product manager for target.com would pay attention to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.895
similar KPIs to purely online businesses.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:55.145
KPIs for the eCommerce business model include the profit margin made on sale items.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:57.980
That is, the payment the customer makes for an item

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.555
minus the cost to the business to produce or acquire the item.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:06.485
Another KPI is the number of users purchasing items.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:10.115
Since there is a limited number of customers in the world,

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:14.185
the number of customers who return and make multiple purchases.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:16.085
The Software as a Service,

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:17.735
or SaaS business model,

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:22.235
provides customers with access to a software for a period of time.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.020
In exchange for payment,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.070
the user gets a software that is beneficial to them.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.780
They have access to the software for as long as they are paying for the service.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.925
Some older softwares, traditionally sold as a onetime lifetime purchase,

00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:38.975
have now moved to the SaaS mode.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:44.715
Instead of paying one time for lifetime access to Microsoft Word or Excel, for example,

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:46.930
Microsoft now allows users to pay

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.515
a monthly or yearly fee to access its suite of software products.

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:55.704
Adobe who software products include Photoshop and InDesign,

00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:59.230
also operates under a Software as a Service model.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.000
In the SaaS business model,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.775
all full-time users are paying users.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:07.795
This means key metrics to track would be the number of

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:10.360
paying users and the rate at which

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.195
those subscribers renew their subscriptions over a period of time.

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:17.360
If the subscription service includes a free trial,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.385
the percent of users upgrading to a paid version would also be important to track,

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:27.230
as all of these KPIs would directly track revenue and potential revenue.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.565
Because users of a SaaS product face a choice of whether to renew,

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:37.255
KPIs that indicate whether current users are likely to renew are also important.

00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:39.600
By tracking user satisfaction,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.480
product managers can know the extent to which subscribers are likely to renew.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.035
More satisfied customers are more likely to renew.

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:52.940
This means tracking user satisfaction provides a leading indicator of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.055
whether the renewal rate and number of subscribers is likely to go up or down.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:00.140
In a similar vein of thinking,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.900
the number of customer support tickets a SaaS product

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.940
receives is an indicator of user dissatisfaction.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.720
An increase in the number and severity of customer support complaints is

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.370
a leading indicator that the renewal rate of subscribers might decrease.
