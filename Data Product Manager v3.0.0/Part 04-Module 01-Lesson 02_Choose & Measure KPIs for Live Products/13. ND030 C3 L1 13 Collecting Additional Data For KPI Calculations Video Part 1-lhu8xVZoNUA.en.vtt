00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
KPIs at the product level,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.995
such as revenue, act as North Stars that guide our product decisions.

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:10.365
Product managers, however, also help determine,

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:13.635
create, and launch new features within a product.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:19.365
Metrics and KPIs are just as important at the feature level as the overall product level.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.255
So when launching a new feature,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.950
it is important to keep in mind the data at a feature level you might want to collect.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.355
While the pirate metrics framework can provide

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.845
a holistic view of a product's performance,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.990
it can also be leveraged to examine the success of a new feature.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.640
Good product managers should be able to tell

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.195
you the number of users exposed to a new feature,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.045
the number who interacted with the new feature,

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.870
and how often users returned and reuse the feature,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.200
plus how much you can make from the new feature.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.440
The same KPIs at the product level applied at

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.810
the feature level help us determine if a new feature is successful.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.920
When instrumenting new features,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.945
it is also important to ensure you can distinguish which customers use the feature.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.580
It is important to track which

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.005
product customers use a particular feature and which don't.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:16.060
Often, a feature might have success with one type of user, but not others.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.150
For example, a meditation app introduces a new set of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.725
story-based meditations for teaching children the basics of meditation.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.320
This feature is much more likely to be used by

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.295
parents with young children than by non parents.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.510
Though some users who aren't parents,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.805
perhaps babysitters or teachers,

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:37.225
might find the feature useful too.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.300
By tracking which customers use the new feature and which didn't,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.300
we can identify if the feature is used differently among different groups

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.335
and we also know who we can talk to in order to get feedback after launch.

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.870
Finally, whenever possible, ensure data is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.710
collected to see when and how a user used a new feature.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.965
By collecting when and how a feature is used,

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:06.080
we gather data that helps us understand why a customer is drawn to use a feature.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.290
For example, perhaps a banking app launches

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.675
a new feature that lets users check their credit score.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:16.760
If a majority of users apply for a mortgage after using that feature,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.180
this is a good indication that the feature is being used by

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.235
customers to see whether they are likely to qualify for a mortgage.

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.960
Such information can then be leveraged by

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.620
a product manager to consider new solutions that might serve

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.200
the customers need such as a feature on

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.475
the mortgage page that shows whether a user is likely to be approved.

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.305
This is just one example,

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:43.640
but it serves to illustrate that understanding where a customer uses a feature in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.355
their product journey provides valuable insights

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:50.610
about what the customer wants to accomplish by using the feature.
