00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Up until now, we've discussed that data closely related to revenue and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.035
customer satisfaction will be a KPI for any profit driven product or company.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.165
As a product manager however,

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:17.430
we need to look for ways our product can drive further revenue and customer satisfaction.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.440
By looking at KPIs related to our customers journey from acquisition,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.020
activation, to retention, we can learn

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.515
a lot about where to focus development time and effort.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:33.140
The idea to break down data into acquisition, activation,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.395
retention, revenue, and referral categories came from Dave Mcclure in 2007.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.320
These metrics are called the Pirate Metrics because

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.654
their initials spelled out A-A-R-R-R or R,

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:48.155
as a pirate would say.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:49.820
Over the past decade,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.970
the use of pirate metrics has become widespread by

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.440
startups and growth hackers as they neatly follow a customer journey.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.360
By calculating pirate metric KPIs around user acquisition, activation,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.195
retention, revenue, and referral,

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:11.045
product managers can see where in the customer's journey something isn't working.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.790
Focusing on these KPIs will help you

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.005
know how you can improve the product you're offering.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:22.595
In this section, I'll cover examples and how to calculate KPIs for acquisition,

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:28.165
activation, retention, and introduce a few new important revenue metrics.

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:32.660
Referral typically involves measuring specific referral features.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.855
We'll be covering ensuring data is collected for new features in a section after this.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:40.850
The first step in a product is to get users.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.890
Users need to know about our product in order to use or purchase it,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.270
so the first step in pirate metrics is to calculate KPIs around user acquisition

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.230
because user acquisition KPIs show how many and how often users are finding your product.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.480
KPIs around user acquisition focus on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.080
measuring the number of users who learn about a product or feature.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.060
Some examples would be,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.860
the number of new visitors to a website or app in a day and the number of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.365
new visitors that are coming from different sources

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.665
such as Facebook ads versus a referral program.

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:19.370
Watching and monitoring user acquisition KPIs

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.365
helps you know if your time should be focused on finding new users.

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.915
If your KPIs in this category aren't performing well,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:28.550
as a product manager,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.440
you'll know you need to do more work to help customers find you.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.940
Boosting KPIs will often mean cross team collaboration with marketing to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.385
ensure your service and product are being

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.990
advertised to the right type of customer, in the right way.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.690
Acquisition is the first step in the pirate metrics framework

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.785
because it is the first step in the user journey to becoming a customer.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.350
It doesn't matter how many customers would love

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.285
your features if you aren't bringing in the customers in the first place.

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:02.645
The second A in the pirate metrics stands for activation.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.720
Activation is how quickly new visitors find

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.205
your product valuable and decide to become a customer.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:14.900
Activation focuses on whether a potential customer goes from being aware of your product,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.750
to taking the first step to becoming a customer.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.850
Looking at activation data,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.815
will show you whether visitors are actually deciding to try your product.

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.554
This is called activation conversion.

00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:31.760
Some example activation KPIs might be the length of time users spend browsing

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.490
your site or product on first visit as this

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.750
indicates the user was interested enough to look around.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.150
Even if the visitor isn't paying at,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.410
a happy first visit shows they've gone from acquired to activated.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.250
Another activation KPI might be the number of users who sign up for an account,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.830
which shows the visitor is activated enough to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.205
spend the time to create a profile to use the product.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:04:00.410
Watching and monitoring user activation KPIs will help you know if

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.975
your time should be focused on the initial moments

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:06.385
where new visitors are deciding to become customers.

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.950
If your KPIs in this category aren't performing well,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.585
as a product manager,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.240
you'll know you need to do more work to help

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.425
customers find your product appealing enough to sign up,

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:20.195
or perhaps improve the on-boarding process

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:23.540
that transitions visitors into potential customers.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.510
Boosting KPIs will often mean ensuring your landing page and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.905
information make clear the value that a customer will get from using your product.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.920
Activation is the second step in the pirate metrics framework

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.125
because it is the second step in the user journey to becoming a customer.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.835
Your acquisition KPIs may look great

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:47.075
and many potential customers maybe finding your product,

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:49.865
but your products still won't be a success if you

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:53.579
aren't able to activate visitors into users.
