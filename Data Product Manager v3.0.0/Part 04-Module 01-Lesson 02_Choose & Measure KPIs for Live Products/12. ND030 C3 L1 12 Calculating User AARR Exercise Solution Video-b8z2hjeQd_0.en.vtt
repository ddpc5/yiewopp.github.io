00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
For this exercise, we needed to examine data provided by the Best App Ever.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.610
First, we need to upload the data and see what we have to work with.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.850
It is always good practice to examine our data file rows and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.735
column names to make sure we know what data we have to work with.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.810
In this data file, we can see four columns.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.605
Marketing expenses, including salaries of marketing department,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.490
business overhead expenses, running the free app,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
total expenses, and new paying customers.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.275
The rows show the months in a year.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:38.985
This means someone has already done the work of gathering expenses paid out per month.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:44.140
First, we need to calculate the customer acquisition costs were total expenses.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.360
Recall that CAC equals the total expense of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.305
customer acquisition divided by the number of new customers acquired.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:55.375
This means we need to add up all the expenses related to recruiting customers.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.220
In this case, that would be marketing and the overhead of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.520
running the free app that users can access before paying.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.975
Then we divide that sum by the number of paying customers.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:07.490
By using this formula,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.710
we can find the CAC for each month.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.380
The second question asks if there is a month with

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.140
marketing methods that seem particularly effective,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.210
or a month that is ineffective.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.440
For an effective month,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.370
we want to look for a month with the lowest customer acquisition cost.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.780
In that month, we got

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.965
the most paying customers for the least marketing and overhead effort.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.855
Looks like this is November.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.080
Those marketing methods and channels used in November might

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.355
be most efficient because they have the lowest CAC cost.

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:40.990
In contrast, we can see the higher acquisition costs in March.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.465
If the app creator use different marketing channels in that month,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.450
they might want to steer away from those methods in the future,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.225
as it costs more to recruit a paying customer than in any other month of the year.

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:53.900
For the third question,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.975
you were asked to calculate the lifetime value of a customer.

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:59.120
To be able to calculate LTV,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.460
you were provided with the transactions of

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.755
five customers who together represent an average customer.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:09.450
First, get the weekly spending for each user.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.370
This is the sum of all money spent by the user in a week.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.840
Then add up all the weekly spending by each user and divide

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.460
it by the total number of users to get the weekly spending of an average user.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.840
This will result in a value of $23.30.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.080
Once you have established the average spending per week per customer at $23.30,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.350
you can go on to calculate basic lifetime value by multiplying

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.305
the average customer spending in a given time period

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.950
by the average customer lifespan in the same time units.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.280
Make sure the revenue and lifespan numbers use the same time units,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.900
such as week or months.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.950
In the case of the Best App Ever,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.485
the average customer lifespan is in weeks, 12 weeks.

00:02:55.485 --> 00:03:00.875
Lifetime value can be calculated by an average customer spending in a week times 12.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.615
For the Best App Ever,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:08.105
the average lifetime value of a customer is $279.60.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.820
Question Number 4 asks if the creator of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.760
the app is spending too much on CAC to be profitable?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.430
One sure sign of this would be if it costs more to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.445
recruit a user than the user returns in revenue.

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:22.240
Essentially, if CAC is greater than LTV.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.560
We want to compare an LTV of

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.120
about $280 with the customer acquisition costs we calculated in step 1.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.150
Since even in March,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.225
our highest CAC month LTV is still greater than the customer acquisition costs of $280.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:41.150
The data tells us the app creator isn't spending more

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.680
getting new customers than it is earning from the average customer.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.715
Of course, we need to know more and have further data about the cost of app maintenance,

00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:52.370
the size of the addressable market, et cetera,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.915
to know if the Best App Ever has a solid business plan.

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:58.475
However, we can confidently say

00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:00.860
their customer acquisition costs don't cost

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.980
more than an average user will return in revenue.
