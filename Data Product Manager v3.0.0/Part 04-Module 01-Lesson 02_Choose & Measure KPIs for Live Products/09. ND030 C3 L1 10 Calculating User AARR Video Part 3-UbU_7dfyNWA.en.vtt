00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
To calculate customer acquisition cost, or CAC,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.720
you must know the amount of money spent acquiring new customers.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.390
Any money spent on marketing, engaging,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.230
or otherwise acquiring and activating a user, is summed up.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.985
Then, divided by the number of paying customers you've achieved.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.850
Tracking CAC as a KPI can show whether

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.015
the marketing efforts of your product are worth the cost.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.139
If two marketing methods both generate 100 paying customers,

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:31.560
but one marketing channel costs more, for example,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.385
then the less expensive marketing channel will have a lower and better CAC.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.250
In addition to marketing expenses, investing resources,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.960
and development time into onboarding demos and free trial versions of a product,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.845
contribute to the customer acquisition costs.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:49.370
As a product manager,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.990
considering the CAC and comparing it to the lifetime value of an average customer,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.630
helps determine whether additional investment in

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.540
the acquisition and activation part of the funnel,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.625
will result in enough revenue to provide a return on investment.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.805
Every customer will generate a certain amount of revenue in their lifetime.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10.235
Some may pay nothing, and others,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.185
especially in B2B products,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.595
maybe whales that produce millions in revenue a year.

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:18.505
When a new customer begins their journey however,

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:22.090
we don't know what their lifetime value will be to the company.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.035
In order to make decisions about whether a product is on the path to profitability,

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:33.145
product leaders calculate and use the lifetime value of an average customer today.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:36.590
To calculate the lifetime value of an average customer,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.320
or LTV, you must know the average amount spent per customer in a given time period.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.710
That is, the average value of the sales multiplied by

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.385
the average number of transaction for customers in a time period,

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:54.100
and multiply that by how long the average customer is retained.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.820
This number will tell you on

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.005
average how much revenue one customer can be expected to generate.

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.000
Please note, we are calculating the LTV of an average customer.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.440
A specific customer might have a higher or lower lifetime value.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.190
LTV is often compared to the customer acquisition cost.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.190
If you spend a lot of money to acquire each new customer,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.505
that investment may not be worth it.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.370
Additionally, calculating LTV draws attention to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.450
the levers that a product manager can focus on to increase revenue.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.180
If the average value of a sale is low,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.900
then increasing the price that customers pay could raise LTV,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.830
but not if raising costs reduces the number of transactions.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.170
If the average value of a sale is lower,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.590
customers will need to make many purchases or stick around for

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.140
a long time for that lifetime value of an average customer to be high.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.870
Depending on the product and its business model,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.840
the best way to raise the lifetime value of an average customer might

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.235
be to raise prices and upsell more expensive packages.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:04.340
That is, raise average value might be to increase the number of purchases, ie,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.500
raise the average number of transactions,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.575
or might be to provide features that keep users

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:13.300
around for a longer period, ie, increase retention.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.650
By keeping an eye on LTV,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.485
we can determine if a new feature might be worth the development time and investment.

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.345
As average customer lifetime value goes up,

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:26.180
we know our product is valuable to customers,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.370
and that value is being monetized.
