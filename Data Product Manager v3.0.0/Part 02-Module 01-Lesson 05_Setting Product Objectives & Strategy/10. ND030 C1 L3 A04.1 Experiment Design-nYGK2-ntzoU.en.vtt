00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.335
An experiment is a test whose primary function is to validate a hypothesis.

00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:10.340
What does this mean exactly?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.530
By principle, it's difficult to take things away from users,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.660
especially if you have a B2B product,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.800
as many of them may have already built operational workflows on top of it.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.200
Experiments are good way to validate that features move KPIs without having to launch

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.720
the feature 100 percent and potentially having to

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.780
roll back if that feature was unsuccessful.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.140
Hypotheses are theories that a feature, product,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.495
optimization would move us towards meeting our key results.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:43.680
A sample template for your hypotheses would be,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
this feature solves the user need through this reason,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.445
thus we expect it to move this KPI

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:57.895
by how much you think the KPI will move by or your threshold of success.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.480
An example hypothesis would be,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.724
if the admin onboarding flows for slack was extended from three modules to seven modules,

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.410
the implementation finish rates within

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.785
the time span of two weeks would increase by 23 percent.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:20.120
In summary, an experiment is a test whose primary function is to validate a hypothesis.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.430
A/B testing is just another name for two variant experiment.
