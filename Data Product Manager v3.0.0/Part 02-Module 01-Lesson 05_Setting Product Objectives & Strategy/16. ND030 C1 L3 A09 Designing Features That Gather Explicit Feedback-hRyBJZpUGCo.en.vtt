00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.915
Implicit feedback or events collected through instrumentation is imperative,

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.165
but again, does not tell the whole story.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:12.420
Users maybe doing something constantly on your product,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.790
but they may not actually be liking it.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.780
For example, if you were the Nanodegree Product Manager at Udacity,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.870
you could assume a user liked your product if they went through

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.380
the entire AI Product Manager Nanodegree course.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.535
However, you don't know exactly what about the course they liked

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:34.230
or what made them stick around without gathering explicit feedback from them.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.600
You could literally just ask them what they liked about the course, what you should do.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.920
But it's not really a scalable from a volume perspective.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.510
You could employ in product experiences such as surveys, ratings,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.535
thumbs up and down prompts,

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:54.545
open-ended feedback models, tips, or referral programs.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:56.165
The options are limitless,

00:00:56.165 --> 00:01:01.340
but only as long as they're direct inorganic to the native because of experience.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.710
Here are some real life examples for users to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.125
provide product feedback without being too obstructive.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:10.550
In Zendesk, end users have the ability to provide

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.470
a rating for a thumbs down or thumbs up in chat.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.805
In Uber, general driver and ride quality could be assessed through rider stars,

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:23.695
tips, and a multiple choice questionnaire at the end of the ride.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:27.845
In Google BigQuery, a SQL engine in UI to analyze data,

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:32.550
there's an open-ended feedback form for their beta products.
