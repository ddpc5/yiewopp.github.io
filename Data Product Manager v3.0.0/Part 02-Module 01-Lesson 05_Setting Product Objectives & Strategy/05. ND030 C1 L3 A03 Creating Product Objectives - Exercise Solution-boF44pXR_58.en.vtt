00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.345
Your answer maybe a little different than mine,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:07.680
but let's go over an example answer in a thought process I had for this exercise.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.220
The prop stated that Edtopia is striving to build

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.515
a platform for freelance instructors to build course content,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.220
edit their videos, and market their work.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.555
We have to take a step back and ask,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:23.815
why are we building this and who are we building it for?

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.450
Existing solutions today, either hire

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.850
professional expertise and handhold them

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.595
through the development of the course like Coursera.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:35.330
This model is fine and the quality of the course material is great.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.770
However, they are cuffed by how much they could

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.895
recruit and guide instructors to make their content.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.780
On the other end of the spectrum, models like Udemy,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.050
function more as an open marketplace for instructors to post

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.150
their content with minimal resources in terms of having an Instructor Success Manager,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.575
video production services, and curriculum guidance.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:59.975
It looks like Edtopia is aiming more for the middle sweet spot,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:05.000
providing instructors with resources for their courses to succeed,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.670
but in a self-serve manner so that the company is not

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.225
kept on a finite pool of instructors at a given time.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.185
This opens up a marketplace for instructors that want to focus on

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:20.075
teaching the subject as opposed to setting up the logistics of teaching itself.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.485
Now product vision for Edtopia course creators,

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:26.090
is to have the tool to self-serve

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.195
their course creation process from content management, design,

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:32.880
infra, analytics, and marketing,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.005
so that they could focus on being the best subject matter expertise,

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.815
and be the best teacher that they could be.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:43.180
You may have heard of a CMS or Course Management System,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.920
which is a way for non-technical users to upload and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.495
manage their content via user-interface.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:55.610
For Edtopia, one of our objectives is to provide an LMS or Learning Management System,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.780
interface and backend, for instructors to self-create course materials.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.810
The key results for this objective are;

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
the average completion of development for a full course is under

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.850
three months based on existing hypothetical data that you've gathered from user research.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.370
The average course NPS or Net Promoter Score,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.980
is to be above 75,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.895
which is considered excellent for the educational industry.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:25.205
If you build it, they will come.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:30.155
Well, they will only come if it's marketed well and to the appropriate users.

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:34.515
For objective two, we will be providing an interface, algorithm,

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:38.995
and dashboard for instructors to configure the strategy of their course marketing spend,

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:41.135
and student candidate targeting.

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.270
Our criteria for success would be that 60 percent of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.055
instructors return net positive ROI on their marketing spend.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.710
Instructors are good at what they teach,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.635
and they're the subject matter expert for that subject.

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:58.640
However, they are most not likely video producers by train.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.660
Objective three, provide video production templates and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.360
automated post-production processes to ensure

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.810
that course videos are high-quality and standardize.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.660
The key results for this objective are;

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.960
the majority of course instructors do not have to use

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.760
third-party video software to edit their videos before publishing,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.300
and a diverse set of video production templates so that we get minimal feedback

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.800
from students saying how the format is too repetitive or formulaic.
