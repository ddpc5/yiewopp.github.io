00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.630
In this video, we'll be learning about KPIs or key performance indicators.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.210
KPIs ensure that you're monitoring the progression and regression of your OKRs.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.135
Good KPIs are actually measurable.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.340
They're either lagging or leading

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.540
indicators that determine the success or failure of your OKRs.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.970
They are malleable or are able to be moved within the given time frame.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.150
Let's go over an example for setting KPIs.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.925
Say you're the product manager at Facebook for birthdays.

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:36.715
One of your KPIs that you've set would be

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:41.305
the average percentage of friends posting on a user's profile.

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:47.285
For short, let's call this ABPR or average birthday post rate.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.690
You'll need to understand the baseline experience of your KPIs,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.985
or what's the current ABPR?

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:56.705
You would determine this through analyzing data at your disposal.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:01:02.360
Key results are determined by establishing threshold of success for your KPIs.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.220
Let's hypothetically say that the current ABPR is 14 percent.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.380
Only to plot out a histogram or

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.310
percentages to determine the standard deviation of the data.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.700
Say we find out that one standard deviation for the mean is four percent.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.845
Basically 68 percent of all users have

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:28.490
10-18 percent of their Facebook friends posting onto their profile during their birthday.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.110
This is key information as this enables us to know that it's not very

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.940
realistic to set the threshold of a success for this KPI to a number like say,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.825
60 percent, but rather more realistically somewhere in the 10-20 percent range.

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:48.110
Whenever you create in large experiments to try to move your KPIs,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.445
these experiments may incidentally diminish other related metrics.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.975
Back to our example,

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.610
after looking through the data,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.565
you realize that close friends tend to directly message users during their birthdays,

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:06.405
leading to engagement in Facebook Messenger for close relationships.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.030
You want to drive more users to post onto their friend's profiles for their birthdays

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.970
but you don't want to over cannibalize the rate

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.210
of birthday messages via Facebook Messenger.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.190
You'll need to set a guardrail metric to determine at what point

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.920
your experiments negative impact on other facets of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.700
the product is not worth continuing on with the experiment.
