00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.955
A product vision or North Star is the ultimate goal

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.200
of what you want your users to do or accomplish with your product.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.920
OKRs or Objectives and Key Results is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.230
a goal-setting framework used by companies to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
centralize the definition in tracking of objectives.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.095
It was first introduced and implemented by Andy Grove at Intel in 1983.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.035
It's popularity is growing even bigger today,

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.375
leveraged by companies large and small,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:35.280
including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Uber, and Zendesk.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.980
Product teams should have one to several sets of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.925
OKRs to help them build the right things for their users.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.810
OKRs could be set on any time period,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.260
but typically on a scale that where change could happen,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.015
either on quarters like Q1 or Q2,

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:54.675
halves like H1 or H2, or even years.

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:57.920
An objective is a clearly defined goal.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920
It does not have to be rigidly quantitative.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.770
For example, the growth product management team

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.200
at Slack may have the following objective for

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380
2020: have a higher proportion of group chat

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.705
software market share compared to Microsoft Teams.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:17.300
Key results are measurable metric targets that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.630
directly influence the success of the objective.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.380
Key results could be both quantitative or qualitative.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.590
Going back to one of our objectives with Slack,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.155
from our user research and data analysis,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:35.060
we noticed that there is a direct correlation in market share based on product renewals,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.015
online reviews, and ability to synchronize with other Cloud ecosystems.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.080
Hence as a result of this,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.045
one key result could be partner with and launch three app integrations with Microsoft,

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.360
so users don't have to switch over to Microsoft Teams if they

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.470
already rely heavily on Microsoft's other products in their workflows.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.875
Another key result could be drive up annual renewals to 82 to 89 percent.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:05.780
The last key result could be to redesign the admin onboarding flow to get

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.690
the average high MRR company to get

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.490
fully up and running in five days instead of the average four weeks,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.360
to improve the negative reviews of implementation costs.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.455
So you can have any number of key results for each objective.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.605
Typically, I've found that two to four is a sweet spot,

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.730
as you don't want to have too many where you're not able to truly focus,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.690
and you don't want to have only one either because your objectives are

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.075
oftentimes multifaceted and need to be attacked by multiple angles.

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:40.670
Key results don't explicitly state what features you launch,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.365
but rather the features,

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:45.350
products, enhancements, and optimizations that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.950
will be built as a result of the key results you layout.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.865
Here are some more hypothetical examples from other companies.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:56.150
At Salesforce, let's say you're a product manager for

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.725
apps enablement and objective for this half of the year, H1,

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:03.995
would be to stabilize the app framework so that

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:08.825
external developers developing for Salesforce incur less breaking changes,

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:11.930
less API outages, and faster time

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.500
to develop and launch your apps on the Salesforce Marketplace.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.500
A key result could be to migrate the remaining 30 percent of external developers

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920
from leveraging v4 to v5 of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.455
the app framework so that you could officially deprecate the former,

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.570
which is now buggy and unsupported.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.490
Another key result could be to reduce the number of 303s or server-side errors
