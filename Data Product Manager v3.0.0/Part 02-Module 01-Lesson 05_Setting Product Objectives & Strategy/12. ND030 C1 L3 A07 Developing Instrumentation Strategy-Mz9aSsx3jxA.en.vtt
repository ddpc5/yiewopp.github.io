00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.265
As a product manager,

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:05.620
your KPIs cannot be measured by you or

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.355
your data science team without an events instrumentation plan and strategy.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:14.545
KPIs are measured through analyzing and calculating events.

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:19.770
Events are data points that are produced whenever an action happens.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.660
Here are some examples.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.280
When you finish playing a song on Spotify an event is produced called songPlayed.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.560
That's just a guess, I don't work at Spotify so I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.925
don't know the actual name, but regardless.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.290
When you sign in to your account on Spotify,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.990
an event is produced called userSignedIn.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.060
When you click into a piece of content on Netflix

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.300
from the homepage to go to the detail page,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.670
an event is produced called detailPageViewed.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.370
Events themselves have additional properties that tell you more metadata

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.915
or information about the details of that event. Here is an example.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.495
When I finish playing a song on Spotify,

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.175
a songPlayed event is produced.

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:06.705
These following properties tell us more about what happened during the event.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:11.315
Events don't just come straight out of the box when your engineers develop the product,

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:14.845
instrumentation is the act of ensuring that events are produced,

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:19.520
saved, cleaned, and stored in a database for access.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.005
Data-driven product managers set instrumentation strategy so that data scientists,

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.410
analysts, and the product manager herself or

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.540
himself has the right data they need to make future decisions.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.870
To set up an instrumentation strategy,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.715
you'll need to work backwards.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:39.800
Start out with the KPIs you've defined and break down the user

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.235
steps it takes to contribute to the KPI in a positive manner, end-to-end.

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.210
Here is an example. Let's say,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.010
you're the PM for a restaurant review and food delivery app.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.710
One of your objectives this year is to increase delivery engagement and retention.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.130
One of your KPIs to support this objective is to increase

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.545
the number of delivery bookings per week divided by the number of users registered.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.820
Given that there are multiple steps in the app that a user has to go through

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.900
to order a delivery and that a user could drop off at any point,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.835
we'll need to know when the final users tend to drop off so that we could focus

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.430
running experiments in the hopes of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.760
improving conversion rates on that specific final step.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.610
Let's walk through the individual steps that a user

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.610
has to take in order to complete a delivery order.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.970
A user goes into the restaurant detail page,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.330
a user clicks on "Delivery",

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.790
the user enters in their orders from the menu options,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.645
and user fills out their billing information, and hits "Submit".

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:48.330
Finally, a user confirms their order.
