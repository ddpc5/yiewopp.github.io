00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.860
In this lesson, we'll be going over how to create OKRs or objectives and key results,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.900
setting out measurable and relevant KPIs or key performance indicators,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.480
laying out your experimentation details,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.645
like your control versus experimental variance.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.120
Building out your instrumentation strategy,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.295
so you could actually measure those KPIs.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:27.299
Finally, setting up methods to gather qualitative data,

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:32.200
so that you can understand why your KPIs are moving the way they're moving.
