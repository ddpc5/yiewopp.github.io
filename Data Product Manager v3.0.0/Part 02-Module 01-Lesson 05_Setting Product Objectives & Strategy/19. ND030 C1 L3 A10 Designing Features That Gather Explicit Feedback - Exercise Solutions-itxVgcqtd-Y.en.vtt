00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.430
Let's take a brainstorm on what features we could build to enable instructors

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.559
to provide explicit feedback during and after course creation.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.919
We can build a feature to send engagement notifications to instructors of two segments,

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.015
ones who've completed course development and ones who've churned.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.630
Engagement notifications we send out to those that have completed

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.150
course development would be to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.555
prompt or ask them if they would like to develop another course.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:38.550
This would provide us a good signal to determine if although they finished their course,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.285
did they enjoy it so much that they would want to create another one.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.780
For the engagement notification for

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.045
those instructors that have churned out of course in development,

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:50.960
this would be a win back e-mail campaign to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.230
determine if instructors just forgot about the completion of

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.720
their course or they really don't want

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
to continue on course development on this platform.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.550
We can also have a questionnaire or survey for course creators,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.780
again, for both segments.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.390
One that have completed a course to determine what platform features they found

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.010
easy to use or difficult to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.340
use and one for instructors that churned out of course development,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.370
to figure out the reasons why course creation was not completed.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.655
We could have an intercom or live chat support widget for course creators

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:30.110
as they work on the platform for them to provide feedback on the LMS,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.140
in addition to receiving any tactical help they might need on an ad hoc basis.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.340
In addition, we could have

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.000
a community forum where instructors could collaborate and chat with

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.550
other instructors and where instructors could

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.880
provide direct feedback to community moderators.
