00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.175
An MVP, or minimum viable product,

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.810
is essentially an experiment at the initial conception of a product.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.125
But rather than just focusing on one feature,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:18.765
an MVP is a collection of features working cohesively together to form a usable,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.560
functional, but not fully fleshed out product.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.890
Here is a real rolled example of an MVP.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.010
Two fledging founders are looking to validate

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
their hypotheses or people of varying demographics,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.920
willing to pay to stay in strangers homes instead of hotels.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.865
So they set up a very basic website to make reservations.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.890
They posted up three air beds in

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.815
their living room of their small apartment in San Francisco,

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:50.740
and provided a home cooked breakfast thrown in there for familial hospitality.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.575
Demand was high, transactions went through,

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.730
and users started referring their friends.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.040
Proving that the idea's viable without having to hire hundreds of employees to build out

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.890
a suite of micro-services to power a recommendation and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.925
booking system to validate the hypothesis,

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:10.770
only to not have it let it potentially pass.
