00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.060
So you take your key results for objective one.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
As stated earlier, KPIs are metrics that we

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
track to see if we're heading away or towards our key results.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.360
Oftentimes, they are directly tied to the key results themselves.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.470
Here we have average course development completion time

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.895
and the average NPS of all courses.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:31.470
Here's our key results for objective two.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.790
The KPI here is not focused on 60 percent,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.460
but rather on the ratio of instructor revenue divided by instructor marketing spend.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.250
It's only considered a success if the KPI is higher than 0.6 or 60 percent.
