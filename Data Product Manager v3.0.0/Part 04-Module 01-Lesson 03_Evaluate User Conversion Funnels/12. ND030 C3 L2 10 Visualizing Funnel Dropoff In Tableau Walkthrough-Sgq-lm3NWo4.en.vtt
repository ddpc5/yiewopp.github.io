00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
To visualize funnel drop off in Tableau,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:07.260
we start with a skills covered in the last section: discerning what data is available,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.600
putting steps in order,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.760
and counting the number of users who make it through each step.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.370
Here is the starting place for visualizing the funnel.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.035
Note that I've already ordered the events and calculated visitor counts for each step.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.635
The simplest visualization to create is the bar chart.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:27.840
A bar chart is a clean and simple way to show drop off between steps in a funnel.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.910
While there are more literal funnel-shaped visualizations possible,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.700
a bar chart shows the decrease in users between

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.440
each step in a way that makes clear the drop off occurring.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.115
To select a bar chart,

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:43.390
we can select that visual type from the Show Me section.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.055
If pages and events are in rows,

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.440
you'll see a long bar chart like this.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.200
I find vertical charts are more easy to read,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.865
so I like to keep my events as columns.

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:57.875
Before this visual can be put in front of others,

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:01.235
we need to make sure that the labels are readable and correct.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.105
We do this by expanding the visual,

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:07.920
re-tiling the chart to represent the data.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.120
Also, while the bars show the relative drop off in number of users at each step,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.975
it's always nice to provide the exact numbers for easy reference.

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:24.785
To do this, I'll go the Label section and select Show mark labels.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.115
Finally, before sharing a visual,

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.335
it is helpful to distinguish the steps with different colors.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:34.010
This makes them stand out at separate moments in the user journey.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.315
To color the bars,

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.820
I just need to drag the dimension of interest,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.230
in this case, pages,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.855
over the color section in marks.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:48.000
Now we visualize the funnel drop off in a way that is easy to understand and share.
