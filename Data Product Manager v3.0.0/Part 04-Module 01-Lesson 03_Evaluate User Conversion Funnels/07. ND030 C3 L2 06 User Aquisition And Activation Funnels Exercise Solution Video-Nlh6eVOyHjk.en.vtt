00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
For this exercise, the specific sales funnel

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.800
you followed when making an online purchase will vary.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.485
But here's an example of the main stages and the most common steps in such a funnel.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.585
The first stage is awareness.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.805
In awareness, the customer has a need and learns of a potential product for purchase.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.100
Knowledge of the specific product can come from

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.515
searches about products to address a problem,

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.525
referral from a previous customer,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.345
or via advertising, paid marketing.

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.260
For example, Nina has a dog that keeps destroying his toys.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.870
So she searches on Google for toys for dog chewy,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.900
seeing and clicking the add for DogToys.com and entering

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.255
DogToys.com are the steps she takes during the awareness stage.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.765
The next stage is evaluation.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:50.920
In evaluation, the customer decides whether they want to purchase a specific item.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.150
In my example, Nina's evaluation steps includes searching DogToys.com

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.480
for extra tough toys and reading reviews of toys to find one strong enough for her puppy.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.770
As part of the evaluation stage,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.045
Nina also places the dog toys into the cart and heads to checkout.

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:12.215
Along the way, she's still considering whether this purchase is worth it,

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:14.990
so she remains in the evaluation stage.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.205
The final stage is purchase.

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:21.565
When Nina enters her credit card information and pays for the toys to be shipped to her,

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.350
she leaves the final stage.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.170
Nina is an example of a successful conversion in the sales funnel.
