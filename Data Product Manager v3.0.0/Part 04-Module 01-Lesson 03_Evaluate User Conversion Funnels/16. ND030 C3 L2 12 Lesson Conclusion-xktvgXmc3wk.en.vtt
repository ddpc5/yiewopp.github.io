00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Congratulations, you have just finished the third lesson of this course.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.875
Now let's summarize what we have learned.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.310
We first learned about how to create a user funnel.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.015
We learned how to break down a user's actions as steps towards a goal.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.330
We also examined the stages of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.365
the traditional sales funnel from awareness, to evaluation,

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.410
to purchase, and then learned how these funnel

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
analysis techniques could be applied to feature usage too.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.830
In the second part of the lesson,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.250
we learned how to calculate funnel drop-off in Tableau.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.325
We discussed evaluating the available data

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:41.950
and ordering events as a user would experience them.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.760
We also learned how to count the number of visitors who made it through each step.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.295
By using the percent change calculation,

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:52.595
we learned how to determine the drop off rate between steps.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.160
Finally, in the third part of this lesson,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.650
we leveraged our learnings in part 2 and went a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.655
step further by visualizing the user funnel.

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:03.410
Converting raw data into appealing visuals

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.960
will strengthen our case if stakeholder buy-in is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.435
needed to spend further resources investigating and iterating on a funnels design.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.135
Congratulations on completing this lesson.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:18.770
In the next lesson, we'll discuss how to analyze data by user segment.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.360
See you in the next lesson.
