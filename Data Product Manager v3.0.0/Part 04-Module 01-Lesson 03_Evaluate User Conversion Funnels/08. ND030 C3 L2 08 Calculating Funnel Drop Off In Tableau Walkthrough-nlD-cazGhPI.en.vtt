00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
Let's walk through calculating a funnel drop-off rate using Tableau.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.905
Step 1, we need to review the available data.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.510
Here I have data for a website that sells items.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.760
I only have user ID and the names of pages here.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.515
The names of the pages correspond to visitors taking a specific action.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.085
Let me go from the raw data source to the workbook area.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.895
By putting the dimensions I'm interested in onto the workspace,

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:31.425
I can quickly see the names of the pages and if they are relevant to the data.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.630
Here I see a homepage,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.520
a payment confirmation page,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
a payment page, and a search page.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
Great, those are the steps a user would take in the purchase funnel.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600
So on to step 2.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520
I want to put the steps in order from

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.775
the first step a user would take to the final goal step.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:53.960
In this case, the final goal is represented by payment confirmation.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.560
So I would make that the final step,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.265
and search is the second step.

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.370
Now that the events are ordered,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.810
I want to move on to step 3 and count the unique sessions for each step.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.535
Just by looking at the data.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.910
I'm not sure if a user could go through the funnel more than once,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.645
or if this is only for first-time purchasers.

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:20.090
To confirm, I can compare the number of records for each event with a number of user IDs.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.845
If they are the same,

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:25.385
I'll know each user only went through the funnel once.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.625
Here you can see I calculated and counted the records.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.985
The number of user IDs is equal to the number of records.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.800
Since the number is the same,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.190
this shows each user is only going through the funnel once.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.315
We can use the count of records for step 4.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:46.580
For step 4, we need to determine the percent change or drop-off rate between each step.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.265
To do this, we apply a table calculation for percent change.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:56.200
Here I go to Quick Table Calculation and do "Percent Difference".

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.240
Now our table shows us the rate at which users drop out of the funnel.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.580
Note that the first step has no drop-off listed,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.365
since a 100 percent of the visitors we analyze always begin at the starting step.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.560
By looking at where users drop off and higher rates,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.050
we can find areas in need of improvement.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.320
Here we can see every step has a large drop-off rate,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.290
including a 54 percent drop-off rate from

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.950
users who land on the homepage and don't begin to search.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.690
But in this example, the highest level of drop-off occurs in the final step between

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.820
payment and payment confirmation at a 92.64 percent drop-off rate.
