00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
For this exercise, we need to find the drop off rates and steps

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.445
where users drop off the least and most on buystuff.com.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.170
To do this, we need to dig into our data.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.080
Here is the data uploaded into Tableau.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.300
When we look at the page dimension,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.205
we can see four different pages;

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.830
the homepage, a search page,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.070
a payment page, and a payment confirmation page.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.620
These four pages aligned with an e-commerce sales funnel.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.955
A website's visitors must land on a landing page,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.150
the homepage, and then look for an item to purchase,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.330
the search page before going to purchase the item,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.690
payment page, and finally submitting

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.790
their payment information, payment confirmation page.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.985
Once we know the events of interest,

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:48.095
we order the pages in Tableau in the order of the user events,

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:53.265
so home, search, payment, and payment confirmation.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:57.860
After this, we can count the number of distinct events on each page.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.349
Because this website has a simple flow,

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:03.650
every page is required of the user to complete a purchase.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.260
Therefore, every page will be shown in the funnel,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.725
and every page represents a user taking a new action.

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:12.485
Let's measure the count of distinct events.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:15.365
Finally, to calculate the actual drop off,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:21.600
we use a quick table calculation of percent change between counts or percent difference.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.155
Looking at our chart,

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:27.100
we can now easily find the answers to the exercise questions.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.480
Question 1 was the percent change between each page in activity,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.725
which we can now see listed here.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:38.365
Question 2 asked between which pages the users drop off the least?

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:42.295
The lowest number is 50 percent next to the search page.

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:47.855
That means about 50 percent of all users continued from the homepage to the search page.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:53.875
Finally, question 3, between which pages or actions do users drop off the most?

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.190
The highest number is 92.5 percent.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.800
Ninety two point five percent of users still in

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.290
the funnel drop off between the payment and the payment confirmation page.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.805
This data doesn't tell us why the drop off rate is so high,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:11.045
but it gives us a clue that we should investigate and iterate

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:15.330
on our product design if we want to improve funnel conversion.
