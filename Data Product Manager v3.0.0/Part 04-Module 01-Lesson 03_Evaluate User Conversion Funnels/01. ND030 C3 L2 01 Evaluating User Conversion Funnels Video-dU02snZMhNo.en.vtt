00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Hi, everyone and welcome to Lesson 3.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.780
Today, we are going to be talking about user conversion funnels,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.260
including how to measure user drop-off between steps,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.395
and how to visualize funnel drop-off in Tableau.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.705
By analyzing user funnels,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:20.445
we'll learn one way to reveal potential opportunities for product improvement.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.090
Using data to identify areas for improvement is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.690
an important step in the cycle of data-driven iterative design.
