00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
In this section, we'll cover how to use Tableau

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.865
to calculate the drop off rate in each step of the funnel.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.840
Calculating the drop off rate between each step in the funnel gives us

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.360
valuable information about where users fall

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.390
off during their journey to the desired action.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.750
To calculate a funnel drop off rate using Tableau,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.565
we can follow four steps.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.490
First, review the available data to look for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.505
the pieces of data that correspond to a user's steps in the funnel.

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:31.760
No matter if you're using Tableau or another calculation program,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.535
you need to know what data you have available.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:39.080
Of course, if you've been instrumenting each new feature and step a user can take,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.855
then you know you'll have the data you need to create and analyze a funnel.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:45.620
By looking at the data,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.500
you can identify which events or pieces of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.510
data represents steps in the funnel that you wish to analyze.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.680
For example, event level data shows a user visited a page at 1:00 PM.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.635
It might be a step in the awareness stage where the users saw and entered the website.

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:06.690
It also shows a user clicked on a button at 1:01.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.350
It might be a step in the evaluation stage

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.140
where the user was interacting with the product.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.210
By confirming the steps in the data,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.515
you can prepare to analyze funnel interactions for all users.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.310
In Tableau, reviewing the available data means finding

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.045
the dimensions that hold the event data relevant to the funnel.

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:29.360
Second, determine how the user's steps should be

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.010
ordered from first action to final goal step.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.190
That means looking at all available steps and determining what steps

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.330
are relevant and can be taken by a user leading up to a goal.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.540
Note that not all steps a user takes will always need to be included in a funnel.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.579
For example, when creating a profile,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.210
a user might be asked to upload a photo to personalize their account.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.445
If uploading a photo is optional,

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:59.420
that step doesn't necessarily need to be included in the user funnel.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.660
Funnel analysis generally concentrates only on the steps

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.050
that are required to occur in pursuit of a specific goal.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.670
To that end, another part of determining step order is to confirm

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.455
which event represents the successful completion of the goal that is being measured.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:17.795
Once the events in steps are known,

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:21.665
they should be placed in order as the user would experience them.

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:24.995
In Tableau, this means putting the events of interests from

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:28.460
top to bottom in a row or left to right in columns,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.535
so they are ready for analysis as a funnel.

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:36.190
Third, count the unique sessions where a user takes each step.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.375
A session is a period of time in which a user interacts with a site or product.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:46.355
If a user interacts with the site or product at different times or on different days,

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:49.100
each of these would be a unique session.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.705
If looking at a funnel where each visitor can only go through the funnel once,

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.600
then counting unique sessions will be the same as

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.115
counting the number of unique users who made it to each step.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:02.840
For example, sometimes websites offer

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.195
a onetime discounted visitors that must be used in that shopping session.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:12.215
Alternatively, if looking at a flow that a user can go through multiple times,

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:16.340
such as a feature that allows customers to review their previous purchases,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.050
we might want to count the number of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.485
unique user sessions that made it through each step in the funnel.

00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:24.620
This will show how the funnel performs in general across

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.205
users with multiple trips through part or all of the funnel.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:33.770
Finally, in Tableau, use a table calculation to determine the percent change,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.335
i.e., drop off between steps.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:40.670
This means using the count of unique sessions obtained previously to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.980
evaluate the relative size of unique sessions from one step to another.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.080
In the funnel as users drop out and the number of

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.455
users that make it to each subsequent step gets smaller,

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:55.925
the calculation will show the percent decrease between each step.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.495
By looking at those steps with a higher percent change,

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:01.760
you can identify areas of greater

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.800
drop-off that may need investigation and further improvement.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.275
In Tableau, to quickly calculate the percent difference,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.660
you can apply a quick table calculation of

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.150
percent difference to the numbers generated in step 3.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.075
Once the calculations are in place,

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:22.400
product managers use this information to look for steps with high and low drop off rates.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.440
Areas with high drop off may need

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.800
further evaluation to determine ways to improve conversion.
