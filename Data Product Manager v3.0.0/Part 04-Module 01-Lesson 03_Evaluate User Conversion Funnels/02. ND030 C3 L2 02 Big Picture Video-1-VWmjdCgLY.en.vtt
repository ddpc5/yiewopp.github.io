00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
While KPIs help a product manager know if our product and features are succeeding,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.585
user funnel analysis tracks the step-by-step use of a product

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:14.520
to look for areas of drop off where our product or feature can be improved.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.220
For example, product managers use

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.600
funnel analysis to track potential users from visiting a website,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.530
to viewing products, to creating an account and see

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.210
at what points users drop out on the way to becoming customers.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.595
By identifying step-by-step all the actions users take to achieve a goal,

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.170
such as creating an account,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.220
we can analyze user data to see which steps are prone to drop off.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.390
Using funnel analysis, we learn where we need to improve our product further.
