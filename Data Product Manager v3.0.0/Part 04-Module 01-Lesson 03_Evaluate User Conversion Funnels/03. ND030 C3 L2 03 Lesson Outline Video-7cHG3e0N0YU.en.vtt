00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
In this lesson, we'll first learn about how to

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.750
look at a user's actions as steps towards a goal.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.560
We'll specifically examine the stages of the user acquisition and activation funnels,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.285
and then learn how these funnel analysis techniques can be applied to feature usage too.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.375
In the second part of this lesson,

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:23.810
we'll discuss how to calculate funnel drop off in Tableau.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.150
Analyzing live user data to identify the steps in a user funnel with the highest drop

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.625
off rates provides great evidence for where product improvements should be focused.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.610
Finally, in the third part of this lesson,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.565
we'll discuss how to visualize funnel drop off in Tableau for use in presentations.

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:46.535
Product managers use such visuals to convince stakeholders

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:51.870
about the need for resources to be spent in specific areas of a product.
