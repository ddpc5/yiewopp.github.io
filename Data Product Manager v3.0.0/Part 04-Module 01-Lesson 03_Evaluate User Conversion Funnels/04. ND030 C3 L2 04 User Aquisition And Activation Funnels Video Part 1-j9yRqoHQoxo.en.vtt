00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
In order to understand where our products can improve,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.150
product managers must be able to look at the steps each user takes to achieve a goal.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.180
Creating a user funnel starts with identifying

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.855
the steps a user takes when going towards a desired action,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.370
such as making a purchase,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.895
or using a new feature.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.690
We'll go over a few examples in the next slides.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.855
But the classic user funnel is the e-commerce funnel,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.940
where a user enters a website,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.710
searches for an item,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.975
puts the item into the shopping cart,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.435
and checks out to purchase the item.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.655
To analyze a user funnel,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:39.750
product managers count the number of users who take each step,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.985
and finally, take the desired action.

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:44.125
The shape of a funnel occurs,

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.695
because after each step,

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:50.830
the number of users may be reduced as customers fall out of the funnel.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.835
When analyzing a funnel,

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:55.580
we can learn about areas in the product that might need

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.135
improvement by seeing where the largest drop off occurs.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:02.690
The step where larger drop off occurs may be confusing,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.080
or difficult for customers to make.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.960
Here is an example of a user conversion funnel in action.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.645
In this example, the goal of the funnel is to convert a potential user into a customer.

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:19.450
First, imagine 100 users click on an ad for an app.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.185
Then, 80 users visit and read the App Store page.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:28.030
Only 50 users download and install the app,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.965
and of those, 40 actually start registration.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:37.455
Finally, 30 of the original 100 users complete registration.

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:39.635
In this user conversion funnel,

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:43.090
30 percent of users converted to become a customer,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.760
and by digging in and looking at the drop off from step to step,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.980
we can see at which parts of the funnel users are most likely to drop off,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.935
in pursuit of the goal of becoming a customer.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:58.115
Funnel analysis first came from analysis of a sales funnel.

00:01:58.115 --> 00:02:01.400
When a customer is deciding whether to purchase a product,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.390
the steps they take in going from potential customer to paying customer,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.585
are traditionally called the sales or marketing funnel.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.594
The sales conversion funnel can be looked at in three stages:

00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:17.715
awareness, evaluation, and purchase.

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:20.370
This step should seem very familiar,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.550
as they correspond closely to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.040
the user acquisition and activation KPIs discussed in lesson 2.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.800
The difference is that while pirate metric KPIs provide

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.885
no star guidance about whether a product or feature is doing well,

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:38.030
funnels allow us to dig into detailed data about

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.800
a customer's step by step journey to find specific areas for improvement.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.605
Stage 1 in the traditional sales funnel is awareness.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:51.605
This is when the potential purchaser becomes aware of a need.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:57.275
For example, a user is aware of his body weight gain and wants to eat healthier.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:58.985
In his awareness stage,

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:02.720
he might be looking for solutions to obtaining a healthy diet.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.940
The user in the awareness stage,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.360
learns of the product being offered as one solution.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.740
An example step that the user might take in the awareness stage would be to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.000
click on an advertisement for fresh vegetables and healthy meal delivery,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.610
and enter the website as the advertisement brings

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.215
a user into awareness of the potential purchase option.

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:27.900
Stage 2 in the traditional sales funnel, is evaluation.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.925
This is when the potential purchaser considers their options.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:34.700
A user in the evaluation stage,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.580
takes the time to learn about their purchase options and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.780
consider whether a purchase is aligned with their interests.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.745
For example, in the evaluation stage,

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:47.735
the user we talked about earlier might be reading user reviews,

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:52.585
comparing prices, and even putting some items into a shopping cart.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:57.080
The final stage in the traditional sales funnel is purchase.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.950
This is when the potential purchaser becomes a paying customer.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.690
This is the final stage,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.655
because this stage is where the ultimate goal of the funnel is met.

00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:11.555
For example, the step taken in this stage by the user we talked about earlier,

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:14.930
might be checking out and paying for some fresh vegetables,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.985
or signing up for a subscription if he wants continuous service.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:23.490
The user step in this stage is to make that purchase.
