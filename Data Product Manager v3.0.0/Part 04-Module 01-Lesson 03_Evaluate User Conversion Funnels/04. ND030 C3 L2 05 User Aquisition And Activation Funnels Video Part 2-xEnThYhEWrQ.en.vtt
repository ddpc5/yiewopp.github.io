00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
The stages of awareness, evaluation,

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:07.740
and purchase guide us when deciding which order to place user steps in a funnel.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.355
By looking at the number of visitors that go between each step,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.595
we can determine where the largest drop off occurs.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.510
The first example is a traditional eCommerce purchase funnel.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.300
During the awareness stage,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.280
we see the step of site visit,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.845
which then moves to the evaluation stage,

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:28.595
where the user reviews the product and considers a purchase.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.245
The user continues to evaluate even as they add the item to the cart.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.210
The last step of valuation,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.785
the last moment for a user to drop out of the funnel occurs when they enter the checkout,

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:45.115
because the final stage and final step in this funnel is the purchase of the product.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:50.915
You can see this example funnel began with 100 visitors but ended with only 10 purchases,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.655
a 10 percent conversion rate.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.030
By looking at which steps are the biggest loss of customers,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.365
we might learn how to improve the shopping experience.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.360
Though funnel analysis traditionally is used for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.165
evaluating customer acquisition and activation,

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.190
the steps one takes to do

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.725
a sales funnel analysis apply equally well to the usage of a new feature.

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:14.600
Creating a user funnel starts with identifying

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.155
the steps a user takes when going towards a desired action.

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.700
In the case of features,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.925
the final goal of the funnel might not be purchase but usage of the new feature.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:28.385
For example, when a new referral feature is launched,

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.370
the ultimate goal and final step of the funnel will

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.310
be the number of users who send referral e-mails.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.125
The steps to get to this goal,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:39.520
from entering the app to learning about the feature,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.655
and during a friend's e-mail address,

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.335
and finally sending the referral e-mail.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:48.125
Regardless of whether the goal is purchase or usage,

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.855
analysis still consists of counting the number of users who make it to each step.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:55.025
For all funnel analysis,

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:58.580
looking at areas where users drop off at high or higher than

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.190
normal rates gives us important data

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.100
about areas that may need improvement in our product.
