00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.425
Let's walk through how to visualize the buystuff.com purchase funnel.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:07.140
To visualize funnel drop-off in Tableau,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.690
we start with the skills covered in the last section;

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.685
discerning what data is available,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:13.200
putting the steps in order,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.350
and counting the number of users who make it through each step.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.955
These are still the first three steps to creating a funnel drop off visual.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.880
Here is a starting place for visualizing the funnel.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.940
I've already ordered the events and calculated visitor counts for each step,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.005
as this was done for our exercise in lesson 3.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.415
To create a bar chart,

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.245
we can select that visual type.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.055
I prefer my bar charts to be vertical,

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:39.720
so let me switch. There we go.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.085
Before this visual can be ready to be put in front of others,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.640
I need to make sure all the labels are readable and correct.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.920
First, I can expand the visual to make sure all the event steps are readable.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.710
Next, I'm going to retitle the chart to

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.785
ensure it clearly represents what is being visualized.

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:02.650
I'll edit the sheet name to user drop off conversion per step.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.115
I'll also add labels,

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:10.915
so it is easy to see the user count per step by going to labels and show mark labels.

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:16.225
Finally, I'll color the bars to provide more visual distinction between user steps.

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:18.590
Now we visualize the funnel drop off for

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.400
buystuff.com in a way that is easy to understand and share.
