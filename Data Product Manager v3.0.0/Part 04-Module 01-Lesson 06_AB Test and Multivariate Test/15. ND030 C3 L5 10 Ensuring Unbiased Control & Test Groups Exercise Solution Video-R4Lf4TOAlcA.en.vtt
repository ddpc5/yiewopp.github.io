00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
In this exercise, we're back with business A and B.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:06.075
Now, we need to advise them on how to create

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:09.150
unbiased test and control groups for their experiment.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.550
A quick review of business A;

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.705
business A wanted to make changes to a page used by existing customers.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:20.205
Specifically, business A wanted to change the design on the page

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:25.260
to push more customers to use a feature that allowed them to link their social accounts.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.775
Because this page and feature has a limited small number of users,

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.640
we recommended business A run an A/B test with

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.380
one experiment group viewing

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.520
the control and one experiment group viewing a change to the page.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.365
In order to create unbiased control and test groups,

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.320
business A should only target desired users.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.335
In this case, the desired users are existing users,

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:53.005
so they should ensure that they only show the test to logged in users,

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.270
and they should balance the user types by randomly

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.320
assigning users to either the test or control condition.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.450
With random assignment, it is likely that devices,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.850
operating systems and even user types,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.130
such as newer versus established users,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.320
frequent versus infrequent users,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.125
would be relatively similar across both groups.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:16.010
However, the business should confirm that these user characteristics are

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.425
roughly similar across both groups to prevent unintentional bias.

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.620
Now let's look at business B.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.890
Business B was a gallery that wanted to make

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.240
changes to a landing page visited by new customers.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.200
Specifically, business B wanted to change the number of pictures on the page to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.390
see what density of pictures would encourage

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.470
customers to click through to learn more about the gallery.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.135
Because this page had a high amount of traffic,

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.150
we recommended that they run a multivariate test that

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.810
tested a different number of pictures across and down the page.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.885
When considering what business B should do to ensure unbiased control in test groups,

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:55.620
they should target only desired users.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.160
The desired users in the case of business B,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.005
was new visitors to the site,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.120
only new visitors, to the best of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.580
business B's knowledge should be put in the experiment's control and test groups.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.005
Next, to prevent bias,

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.985
the business should randomly place new visitors into control and test groups.

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.190
As they are performing a multivariate test,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.710
the business may want to use a framework for multivariate testing that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.765
assigns users at different rates based on the impacts seen from different designs.

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:26.150
If the business does not have the resources to use such a framework,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.540
they can assign each new visitor to one of the test states by

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.275
randomly assigning users to a control or one of the test groups.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:36.590
User characteristics should be roughly balanced and therefore,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.210
will not bias the results.
