00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
Throughout this course, we've discussed ways that product managers can gather

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.015
and analyze data to determine the next best steps for our product.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.910
With experiments, product managers can finally

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.615
test whether a new feature has the desired impact.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.390
"The proof is in the putting," as they say,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
and putting new experiences in front of users is the best way

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.800
to know if your product changes will have the impact you seek.
