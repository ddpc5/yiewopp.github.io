00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Let me give you an example of how to analyze an A/B test result.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.690
Let's use the data from an A/B test meant to increase the number of user purchases.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.685
In this experiment, there were 1,500 users in the control group,

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:15.630
and 1,600 in the test group.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.910
The control group made 200 purchases,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.370
and the experiment group made 250.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.100
From these numbers, we can see the test group made

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
slightly more purchases per user than the control group.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.985
However, this difference could be due to random chance.

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:32.640
We need to use a t-test to see if the differences in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.885
conversion rate are large enough that it was likely the result of the experiment.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:38.460
To perform a t-test,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
we will need a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.500
In this example, our null hypothesis would be that there is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.690
no difference in the purchase rate between users and the control and test groups.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.975
The alternative hypothesis, what we as product managers hope is true,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.045
is that there is a difference in the purchase rate between the test and control groups.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.560
We also need to set the competence threshold.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.225
I chose 95 percent,

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.265
and I will set it as a two-tailed tests,

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:08.350
since a test group can convert higher or lower than the control group.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.565
Now that we have the data we need,

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:12.350
we can calculate the p-value.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.290
There are many free online calculators that can help you

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.970
confirm if your test results are statistically significant.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.890
In this statistical significance calculator,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.080
you can enter the number of visitors or users in your control A group,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.210
and experiment B group.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.910
In this case, 1,500 control visitors, and 1,600 tests.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.400
Then, we add the number of users who convert it,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.895
which is this case the number of users who made purchases,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.830
200 for the control group,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.995
and 250 for the test.

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.600
Some statistical significance calculators will

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.465
ask you if a test is one-sided or two-sided,

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.640
which means one-tailed or two-tailed.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.410
Product tests can almost universally make the conversion target go up or down.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.105
You should always choose two-tailed if using a calculator that asked this question.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:04.955
Finally, you might be asked your confidence level.

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.000
The higher the number, the stronger your evidence needs to be.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.430
Generally, 95 percent confidence is considered a good choice.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.245
When you have a 95 percent confidence level,

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:20.170
you are looking for a p-score or p-value lower than 0.025.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.925
If you're p-score is less than 0.025,

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:25.310
the null hypothesis can be rejected,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.180
and the alternative is accepted in its place.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.140
If your p-score is greater than 0.025,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.070
you can say with confidence that the differences you saw,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.790
were due to more than random change.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.235
The difference is most likely would not be replicated if the tests were expanded.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.250
Almost all calculators will tell you if your results are

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.850
statistically significant without you needing to look at the p-value.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.810
In this case, the result is not statistically significant.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.000
We can confirm this by looking at the p-value ourselves,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
0.0345, and noting that it is greater than 0.025.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.950
This means we cannot reject our null hypothesis that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.785
the test and control groups have the same rate of purchase.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:07.985
The test did not result in a statistically significant different rate of purchase,

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:09.775
between the two groups.

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:13.160
In this example, we used a calculator to see if the results of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.435
an A/B test were statistically significant by comparing our control A,

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.345
to our experiment results B.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:20.955
For a multivariate test,

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:22.830
we will compare our control A,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.770
to experiments B, and then A to C,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.875
and A to D, and so on,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:33.240
to see if any test states had a significant effect on the conversion for that experiment.
