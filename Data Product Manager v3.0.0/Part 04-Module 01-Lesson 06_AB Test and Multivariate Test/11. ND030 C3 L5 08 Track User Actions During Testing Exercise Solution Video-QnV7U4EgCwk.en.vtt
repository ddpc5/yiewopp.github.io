00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
In this exercise, you are asked to revisit the testing plans for business A and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.630
business B and list what tracking should be in place before an experiment began.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.775
Let's review business A.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:16.440
Business A wanted to make changes to a page used by existing customers.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.670
Specifically, business A wanted to change the design of the page to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.335
push more customers to use a feature that allowed them to link their social accounts.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.890
Because this page and feature had a limited small number of users,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.605
we recommended they run an A/B test with one experiment group

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:38.270
viewing the control and one experiment group viewing a change to the page.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.210
When considering what businesses A should track,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.440
we know it is important to track user characteristics that change by session,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.360
like device and browser type,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.010
in case there are differences in results by these factors.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.080
In order to calculate the conversion rate for the control and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.700
test groups and to ensure that they show a consistent test state to each user,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.725
that is, that users in one test state

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.475
only ever see that test state during the experiment.

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:07.970
Business A should track which users see the original control page and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.830
which users see the page with the change

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.910
intended to highlight the social linking feature.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.220
Finally, business A needs to track whether the users perform the desired action.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.780
In this case, linking their social accounts.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.430
They will need to track which users perform this action so the rate

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.595
of conversion can be compared between the test and control groups.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:30.900
Now let's look at business B.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.310
Business B was a gallery that wanted to make

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.590
changes to a landing page visited by new customers.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.470
Specifically, business B wanted to change the number of pictures on the page to see

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.630
what density of pictures would encourage

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.865
customers to click through to learn more about the gallery.

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.750
Because this page had a high amount of traffic,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.540
we recommended they run a multivariate test that

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.320
tested a different number of pictures across and down the page.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.560
When considering what business B should track,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.745
we know it is important to track user characteristics that change by session,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.950
like device and browser and operating system.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.300
We also learn it is important to track the information

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.720
needed to decide whether a user should be part of an experiment group.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.520
In the case of business B,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.640
this means tracking whether a user is a first-time visitor,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.160
so they can know whether they consider that visit as

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.805
part of their experiment aimed at new users.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:28.630
As previously discussed, one way to do this would be to drop a cookie and not show

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.890
the experiment or include

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.235
a user's actions if the user already has a cookie from the site.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:37.500
In order to calculate the conversion rate for the control in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.095
test groups and in order to ensure they show a consistent test state each user,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.120
business B will also need to track

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.905
the exact version of the multivariate test seen by a visitor.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:52.960
Finally, business B needs to track whether the users perform the desired action.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.510
In this case, clicking through to learn more about the gallery.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.210
Only then can the rate of conversion be compared

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.030
between the control and the many test groups.
