00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
When deciding whether to use an A/B test,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880
there are important benefits and drawbacks to keep in mind.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.050
A major benefit is that A/B tests need fewer users than

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.670
multivariate tests to get statistically significant results from a small effect size.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
When working on an experiment with a small number of users,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.715
if we have to split the users into many groups,

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.325
we won't have very many users per group.

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.950
When there aren't very many users in a test group,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.930
it is hard to prove that a difference among

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.825
the test and control is statistically significant.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.810
Therefore, if you have a small number of users,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.985
it is best to use an A/B test.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.670
Since an A/B test only creates two different cases to test,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.485
it requires fewer users than an experiment that needs

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.860
enough users to fill multiple test groups.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.870
However, there are drawbacks to A/B tests,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.310
the most obvious of which is that in a proper A/B test,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.935
you can only test one change at a time,

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.380
and you also don't have the ability to see how

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.465
different changes interact together in influencing user experience.

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.625
When deciding whether to use a multivariate test,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.585
there are important benefits and drawbacks to keep in mind.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:10.909
Benefits of multivariate tests include that,

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.375
the tests allow you to test many different variations at once,

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.480
and the test can show you how different changes work

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.030
together so that you can find the most effective combination of changes.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.605
However, multivariate testing has drawbacks.

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:27.280
As we mentioned before,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.930
we need enough users in each group to show statistical significance.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.425
If an effect size is small,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.720
as many experimental effects may be.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.560
This means a large number of users must be recruited to be able to show

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.880
statistical significance if there are many variations or changes to be tested,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.000
since you'll need enough users to fill each test group.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.225
Additionally, as we saw in the visual example,

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:52.975
multivariate test quickly lead to a great number of test states.

00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:54.685
Running large number of tests,

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:57.790
including sorting users randomly into many variations,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.135
can be difficult for this and the above reason,

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:03.040
many companies that do a large amount of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.920
multivariate testing either build a special testing framework

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.160
or use an open source or commercial testing product that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.975
makes a sorting of users into different test conditions easier.

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:17.300
Whether an A/B or multivariate test is used,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.450
product managers gain insight from experiments as to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.735
whether their proposed changes will have the hypothesized effect.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:28.620
This makes experiments an important tool and the product manager toolkit
