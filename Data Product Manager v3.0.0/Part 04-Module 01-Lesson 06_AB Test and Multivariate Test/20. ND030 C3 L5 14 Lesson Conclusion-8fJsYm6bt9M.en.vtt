00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
Congratulations, you have just finished the sixth and final lesson of this course.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.070
Now let's summarize what we have learned.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.530
In this lesson, we first learned about

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.040
the difference between an A/B test and a multivariate test.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.180
We also learned the benefits and drawbacks to each type of test,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.840
and which tests will be best for different situations.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.760
In the second part of the lesson,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.114
we covered how to track user actions,

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:30.235
discussed the importance of instrumentation throughout an entire experiment,

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.110
and learned the importance of selecting a KPI or

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.285
conversion rate that we will use to measure the success of a test.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.410
In the third part of this lesson,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.450
we talked about the importance of recruiting

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.085
test participants in a way that prevents bias in the results.

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.645
Finally, in the last part of the lesson,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.050
we discussed how to interpret the results of the test by performing

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.800
T-test to show statistical significance of any observed effect.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.460
We also learned how the results of a test show product managers whether

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.300
the test can be expanded or the idea needs to be revisited.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.540
Data-driven product managers get ideas on how to improve

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.665
a product by analyzing usage data and talking with customers.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:15.620
Experiments like A/B and multivariate tests provide a way to validate those hypotheses.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.440
You've just completed the sixth and final lesson in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.250
this course on applying iterative design principles to a live product.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.250
Congratulations, and good luck on the final project.
