00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this exercise, you are asked to look at data from

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.915
a website that launched a classic A/B test of its Landing Page.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.715
For about half its users,

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.985
the original Landing Page or old_page was shown.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.605
For about half of the users,

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.930
a new_page or new design was shown,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.090
but still have the same call to action,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.675
to subscribe to a newsletter. Here's the data.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:26.895
The first question was to calculate the number of users in the control and test group.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:30.030
To calculate the number of users in the test group,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.060
you need to count the distinct number of user IDs

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.690
associated with the group seeing the new design of the Landing Page.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.105
In the new page, we see 146,317 unique user IDs,

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.285
that's how many there are in the experiment group.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:51.790
In the control group, we see 146,265 IDs.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.910
If you got 147,239 users,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.985
remember that you need to count the number of unique users,

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:03.160
not the number of times any person visited the test or control page.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.975
After calculating the number of users in each group,

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:11.120
question 2 asked you to calculate the number of conversions on the testing control page.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120
By counting the number of converted equals one when

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.630
Landing Page equaled new_page or Landing Page equals old_page,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.429
we know the number of conversions,

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.860
that is the number of times users subscribe to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.485
the newsletter in the test and control groups.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:25.895
For the test group,

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.255
there were 17,498 conversions.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.970
For the control group, there were 17,739.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.620
Question 3 asked whether the results of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.580
this experiment were significant at a 95 percent confidence level.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.160
I entered the number of visitors and the number of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.620
conversions for both the control A and test B state.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.275
For results to be significant at the 95 percent confidence level,

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:55.265
the p-value would need to be lower than 0.025.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.455
However, the p-value here is 0.92.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:02.000
This means the results of this experiment are not significant.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.340
We can't say that any difference seen in the results is due to more than chance.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.240
Based on this, question 4 which asks if

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.400
the Landing Page should be rolled out to all users can be answered in the negative.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.950
The Landing Page should not necessarily be rolled out to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.465
all users as the results of the test are not significant.

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:22.310
This means the new test Landing Page cannot be said with

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.375
confidence to lead more users to sign up for the newsletter.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:29.270
The website should continue to test different Landing Pages to see if they can

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.710
generate a significant test result that shows higher conversion in the test condition.
