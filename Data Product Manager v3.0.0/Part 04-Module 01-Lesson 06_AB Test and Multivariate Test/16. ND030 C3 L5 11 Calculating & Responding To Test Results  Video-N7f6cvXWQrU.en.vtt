00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
The results of an A/B test or

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.915
similar experiment can be evaluated by something called a t-test.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:11.370
A t-test compares the means of two groups to see whether any difference

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.870
in the means is large enough that it is probably not due to random chance.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.795
In the case of an A/B or multivariate tests,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.680
a t-test helps us understand whether any differences observed in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.630
conversion rate are likely due to the change we made to the test groups experience.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.680
To properly evaluate the results of a t-test,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.835
there are three steps that need to be taken before testing.

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:37.425
Step 1, is stating the null hypothesis,

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:40.565
the null hypothesis is not an affirmative statement,

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:45.355
but rather represents the idea that the control state is not different from a test date.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:47.660
You run an experiment hoping to have

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.460
large enough differences between control and test to prove that test date is different,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.600
this is called rejecting the null hypothesis.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.820
A generic null hypothesis would be that customers do

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.305
not convert better with a test state compared to the control state.

00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:06.365
Step 2 is the hypothesis you want your experiment to show.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:10.100
For example, customers prefer our new landing page.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.680
A generic alternative hypothesis would be

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.785
customers will convert differently with this change.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:19.185
Step 3 is a set a confidence threshold,

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.135
every experiment has some chance of error.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:24.890
It is worth noting that product managers almost

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.935
universally use a 95 percent confidence level.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:32.765
If the results of the tests at 95 percent confidence appear statistically valid,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.100
there's only a one in 20 chance that the result is an error.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.930
95 percent threshold is fairly strict,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.810
but not as strict as a 98 percent confidence level

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.425
that is more common in medical studies with higher stakes.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.680
On one hand, a higher confidence level means you won't get

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.270
as many false positives that declare your experiment likely had an effect when it didn't.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.930
On the other hand, a higher confidence level also means you might declare

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.775
a tests to not have had an effect when it actually had a weak one.

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:05.150
Setting a confidence interval before performing a test ensures you aren't tempted

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.015
later to lower your confidence threshold to make your results statistically significant.

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:14.390
Once the hypotheses and competence threshold for an experiment have been set,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.040
you can move on to Step 4, running the experiment.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.500
When the experiment has been run and data collected,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.125
Step 5 is to see whether any test groups perform better than the control.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.565
To calculate this, you will need to know

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.240
the number of users in the control group and in each test group,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.595
the number of conversions in each group,

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:37.625
and the competence threshold you want to use for the test.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.830
By entering this information into any of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.145
the free statistical significance calculators available online,

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.350
you will be able to see if the test group

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.515
performed significantly different than the control group.

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:51.890
Other than the number of users and conversions in each group,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.500
some statistical significant calculators will

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.745
ask you if a test is one tailed or two tailed.

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:00.230
A two-tailed test means your test might make

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.415
the conversion rate worse or better, higher or lower.

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.740
For example, the red button from

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.995
the previous example might increase newsletter readership,

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:13.595
but it also might have a bad impact and decrease readership.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:16.234
Because the results might go in two directions,

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:17.875
the test is two-sided,

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.260
almost all product experiments will be two-tailed tests.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.230
Most online calculators will tell you if the results are

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.160
significance by telling if the p-value is less than a threshold.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.215
Without going into too many details,

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.580
if the competence threshold you choose is 95 percent,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.400
and it is a two-tailed test,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.185
the value of the t-test is compared against 0.025.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.710
When the p-value is less than 0.025,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.090
the difference in the control in the experiment conversion rates can be

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.764
considered significant at 95 percent confidence.

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:54.400
In other words, the null hypothesis can be rejected.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.965
The final step, Step 6,

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.974
is to take action based on the results of your experiment,

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:01.910
if your evaluation found the change to be

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.804
helpful and the results are statistically significant,

00:04:04.804 --> 00:04:08.485
you can expand the test condition to more or all of your users.

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:12.545
If the change didn't have the desired effect or the results aren't significant,

00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:14.300
you should keep experimenting.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.235
In fact, whatever the results,

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.025
good product managers will always be running experiments

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.890
and evaluating the results to improve their product.
