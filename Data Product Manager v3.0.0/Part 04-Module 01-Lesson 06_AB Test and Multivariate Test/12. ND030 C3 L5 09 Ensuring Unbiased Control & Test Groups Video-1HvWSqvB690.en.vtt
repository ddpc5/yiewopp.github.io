00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
When it comes to experiments,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.230
you want both your control and your test or

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.170
experiment group to share the same characteristics.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.035
That way, if something is different in the results,

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.930
you know it is the change you made that caused it.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.825
When choosing who to expose to an experiment,

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.970
you need to determine what type of user you are testing.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.430
Is it every user?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.330
In earlier examples we looked at businesses who only

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.060
wanted to test the effects of changes on new users.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.585
So in sorting users into the control and experiment groups,

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.400
that business would only want to put new users in either group.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.125
In addition to everyone being a target user,

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.330
you'd want other user characteristics to be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.060
balanced between the control and experiment group.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.430
Age, race, income; we'd want

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.605
relatively the same amount of users of each type in each group.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.690
A great way to get balance is by randomizing

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.480
who is in the control and who is in the test group.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.745
Put one visitor into the control group,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.860
put the next visitor into the test,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.310
and after that, put the next visitor into the control group, and so on.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.040
Randomizing who is in what group generally

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.885
results in a balance of user characteristics between the groups.

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:11.750
If your company is performing extensive multivariate testing,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.530
the business may want to invest in a framework for multivariate testing that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.720
assigns users at different rates based on the impacts seen of different designs.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.410
Using an established framework,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.350
or creating one based on strong data science principles,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.500
can decrease the number of users required to perform the test.
