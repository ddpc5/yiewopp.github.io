00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
In this exercise, you've been called in to consult with

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.295
two businesses who are deciding between running an AB or a multivariate test.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.250
Business A is looking to update the design

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.505
on a page that is only used by existing customers.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.140
They have a variety of colors and images they could test on this page.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.604
But since the pages open only to existing customers,

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:25.155
they have a limited number of users to test with.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.165
Given the factors listed above,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.760
the advice you should provide to the business is to use

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.565
an AB test on the new design of the page.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.365
With a small number of users,

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:36.180
it would take a long time to receive

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.010
enough visitors to gain conclusive evidence on the best direction to take

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.680
the page if they used a multivariate test that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.150
tested many different pages with different colors and images.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.465
Now let's consider business B.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.020
Business B wants to run an experiment on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.280
the landing page that new potential customers land on.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.225
Business B is a gallery,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:01:00.155
and they want to find the perfect number of pictures to show on the landing page,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:04.880
both across the screen and down the screen to show potential customers enough of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.160
their gallery collection to entice them to learn more

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.680
about the business without overwhelming them.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.960
Business B also reports a high amount of traffic to the landing page.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.520
Given that business B wants to test a range from

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.325
one to many pictures across and down their page,

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:24.410
and given that business B reports a large number of new users landing on the page,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.425
you should suggest that business B consider a multivariate test.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.600
Business B has the traffic to come to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.300
a conclusion even when testing multiple options and variations.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.535
Given the wide range of variations they might want to test,

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:41.900
business B should consider using dynamic tools to adjust the number of pictures shown

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.100
on the site to determine the number of pictures that result in the best clickthrough.
