00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Hi everyone, and welcome to lesson 6.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.650
Today, we're going to be talking about A/B and multivariate tests,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.490
including how to choose appropriate tests for a situation,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.665
how to track data during a test,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:18.195
and how to evaluate a test result for statistical significance.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.690
Experiments like A/B and multivariate tests allow

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.255
product managers to know with confidence

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:27.315
whether a new feature results in desired outcomes.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:33.340
Designing and launching tests is an important part of data-driven iterative design.
