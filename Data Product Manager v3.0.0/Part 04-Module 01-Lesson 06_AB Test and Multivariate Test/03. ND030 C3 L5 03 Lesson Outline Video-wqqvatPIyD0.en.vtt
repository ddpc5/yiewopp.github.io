00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lesson, we'll first learn about A/B and multivariate

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.175
experiments before discussing the benefits and drawbacks of each type of test.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:13.095
We will also talk about how and when to use each type of experiment.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.225
In the second part of this lesson,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.560
we'll discuss how to instrument and track user actions during tests.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.770
This is important as we need to ensure the correct tracking

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.455
is in place to be able to see whether our tests are a success.

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:29.900
We'll also discuss how to place participants into test and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.230
control groups to ensure an unbiased sample,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.475
so that we know the results of an experiment can be trusted.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:39.395
Finally, in the last part of this lesson,

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:44.359
we'll learn how to analyze test results to ensure findings are statistically significant.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.400
The findings from experiments can show

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.910
product managers whether to expand the feature to more users,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.400
or whether to go back to the drawing board

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.040
as part of an iterative cycle of product design.
