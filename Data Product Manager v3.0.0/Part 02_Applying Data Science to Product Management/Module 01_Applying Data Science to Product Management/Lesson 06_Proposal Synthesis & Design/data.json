A number can suffice, if that’s all you need to prove your point.\n- Have visualization styling match the design language of the company, if possible.\n- It should be visible from 100% zoom; assume you won’t be able to zoom in.\n- Minimize text, and let the numbers speak from themselves.\n- 2 insights at the maximum per visualization - you don't need to show everything.\n- Provide links to visualizations or the underlying SQL queries in the appendix for deeper exploration.\n- Include any data caveats and/or assumptions made in the appendix\n- Include percent change over time, if you’re sticking with raw numbers.\n\n### Recommended Reads\n\n- Edward Tufte’s [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information)",

              "text": "Exploratory data analysis is where you start with one general question you have around a dataset, where the answer leads to another question, where the answer leads to even another question, and so forth. You end up with an insight (or multiple) that you and your team can now take action on.\n\nLet’s say you’re the product manager for an e-commerce eco-sustainable shoe store. You designed and ran an A/B test where 50% of customers saw the site as normal and did not receive free shipping (the control group), while the other 50% saw a free shipping promotional banner and automatically received free shipping if their order’s subtotal was greater than or equal to $80. \n\n- The experiment resulted in 75,000 unique visitors to the control bucket and 75,000 unique visitors to the variant bucket.\n- Visitors were allocated to one of the buckets at random. You can assume that all visitors were new visitors. \n- Using exploratory analysis, determine and present whether or not we should offer free shipping to all customers, leveraging the experiment results, downloadable [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5ebc929c_experiment-results/experiment-results.zip).\n- Upload into Tableau or use the below Postgres instance to run the analysis.",
