              "text": "***Events*** are data points that are produced whenever an action happens. \n\n***Instrumentation*** is the act of ensuring that events are produced, saved, cleaned, and stored in a database for access.\n\nEvents are necessary to calculate KPIs. They are also leveraged for analytics use-cases all across the board, from training machine learning algorithms, to data science deep-dives, and even running triage on product outages.\n\nYou should capture every step of the user journey, logging each step that they take to meet a goal (like finish onboarding), so that you could analyze where if there are any leaky points in the funnel that are heavily preventing the user from meeting their goal. \n\nIt's best practice to name your events in camelCase nomenclature (first word uncapitalized, proceeding words capitalized), like `userOnboardingCompleted` or `userSignedIn`.\n\nFor standardization, name the event starting with the subject, then the predicate. For example: in `userSignedIn`, the subject is the user. What did they do? They signed in to the app. \n\nEvent properties are best named with all lower cases, and an underscore in between. For example: `artist_id` and `ingest_timestamp`. \n\nYou should document (or establish a process for the company to document) any events that you create into a centralized, accessible place for data end-users to quickly search and understand the definitions behind events to leverage for their analyses. Some sample knowledge base tools you could use to store event definitions are:\n- [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)\n- [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs)\n\nSome popular third-party programs that facilitate the engineering process in collecting and visualizing events include:\n- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)\n- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/)\n- [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/)\n- [Heap](https://heap.io/)\n- [Segment](https://segment.com/) (Event collection only)",
