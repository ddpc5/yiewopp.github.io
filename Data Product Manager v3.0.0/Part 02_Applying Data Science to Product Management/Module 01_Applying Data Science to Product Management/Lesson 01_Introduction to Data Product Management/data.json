To build resilient and accessible databases, data stores, and caching layers for frontend applications to be able to successfully create, read, update, and delete data on a real-time (or dependent on your product requirements). Receives and stores event data from frontend clients, to later send off to the data warehouse. \n \n**Legal, privacy, and compliance teams** - to determine data processing regulation requirements, and/or ensure that the data products you are building are compliant with consumer protection laws.\n\n**Finance & business operations** - to help you measure unit economics, business growth, and financial health metrics (like revenue, churn, retention, gross margins, new user acquisition rates, profit, loss), or quantify opportunities for regional & global expansion\n\n**Sales & customer success** - As the product manager, you’ll need to evangelize the limitations & capabilities of the current product, in addition to providing them insights on the future roadmap. They’ll also provide you feedback on the reasons or lack of features on why potential customers may not end up signing deals or going to other competitors.\n\n**Localization/Internationalization** - to have your product localized, or have text dynamically translated into the various languages you support for international adoption and accessibility.\n\n**Quality assurance engineering** - their goal is to break your product, or expose bugs in your product before your external users do. They may end up finding a lot more issues than your team can physically work on and you’ll need to leverage analytics to make a determination on which issues to tackle first based on existing feature usage.",

This differs based on company size and culture. Generally, for startups and small enterprise companies, there are no dedicated project managers, and product managers have to carry this load. However, for larger companies, there may be project managers on staff, so that product managers could focus more on product strategy and what is called out above.\n- Engineering management, or directly managing engineering reports, reviewing their code, and providing technical mentorship\n- Being the primary decision maker on technical architecture. That’s the primary role of software architects. Great product managers have a good grasp and understanding of the software architecture for the products they own, and have influence over the decision, but have trust that their engineering teams will deliver. \n- Writing code. Half of the product managers I’ve worked with came from engineering backgrounds and still poke at code time-to-time, half came from a non-technical background. Both are equally as successful, assuming that the latter has a good understanding of the capabilities & limitations of their team’s tech stack & microservices.",
